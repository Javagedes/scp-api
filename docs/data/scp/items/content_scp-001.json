Lighter flicking.</em>)</p>\n<p>My grandmother loved to play the games she could win. Her favorite was <em>Find the Lady</em>. All you need is a ball, three cups, and a rube to play. There was never a shortage of eager and willing rubes.</p>\n<p>Grammy relished in showing off every cup as slow as she could, then covering the ball and going to work once she had their trust. Rube watching, she'd shuffle and move 'em all around fast as tilt-a-whirls. Rube, with luck, picks the right cup. Oh, the sweet talk she'd use to string them along, come on, double down, let's play one more time, just for the laughs. Poor saps get convinced they've sliced the gambling knot. Everyone was ready to think they were special.<br/>\nWe both had a sixth sense for knowing when rubes were getting ready to cash out. By then, they're not even the same person they were when the game started, not after they've been on a hot streak long enough that the money's as good as half-spent to them.</p>\n<p>Zapruder is being played as a shell game. That's the point. If you've seen any home movies\u2014 the shaky blurs, the way the timing always seems just a little 'off'? That's by design. The unreality on the surface conceals that if you look at it hard enough, you'll find the fatal flaw. You'll find where the Lady is hiding.

Oswald's first shot missed, striking a concrete curb. The second shot mortally wounded the President and injured the Governor. A third shot (SCP-001) lethally vaporized U.S. President Kennedy's cranial cavity.\n\n\n\nFor the approximate decade between Incident-001-\u0393 and the ascension of President Gerald Ford, SCP-001's effect was widespread but largely benign. The disparity between perception and reality was growing, but gradually and in a linear fashion. The fractalization did not begin to occur until the failed attempt to assassinate President Ford on September 5, 1975 by Lynn \"Squeaky\" Fromme. \n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a>\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0name=ford|\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0caption=38th U.S. President Gerald Ford exactly 11 years and 10 months after Incident-001-\u0393.|\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0width=600\n\n]]\n\n\n\nIn both crowds, all witnesses reported seeing differing versions of the events, most of which did not have President Ford surviving. Two weeks later, Sara Jane Moore made a subsequent attempt on Ford's life in order to reconcile her knowledge of his death with his visible living person. The exponential spread of SCP-001's effect can be demonstrated by Gerald Ford's sincere belief from at least 1976 until his death that the Soviet Union had withdrawn from eastern Europe during the Nixon administration.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a>\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Badgeman.jpg|\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0caption=Alleged photograph documenting the 'Badge Man'.|\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0width=300\n\n]]\n\n\n\nHistorical documents reflecting the official story are to suggest that it was the scandal which caused the proliferation of distorted information throughout society, and not the survival of President Ford.\n\n\n\nAny scenario, whether there exists witness testimony or not, could be true given the ephemeral nature of truth and falsehood on a conceptual level.\n\n------\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ {{Suspect & Witness Testimony}}\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n> [[collapsible show=\"Police Log - Babushka Lady\" hide=\"__Babushka Lady__\"]]\n\n> **Foreword:** //The so-called \"Babushka lady\" was briefly held in custody by the Dallas Police, giving a brief statement before she was released.

II - Individual-Aggregate Level Veil Effect\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n\n\nThe most common effect of SCP-001 is frustration. The belief that one is skilled, but unable to get a job, or that they are wonderful people yet nobody seems to like them. Unable to understand that they are being paid less than they think they are. Feeling cramped and confined even if they see themselves living in a big house all to themselves.\n\n\n\nWrongness is there, it can be felt, but it cannot be explained. It manifests in psychological disorders such as Imposter Syndrome. At a certain level, they know that they don't belong. One more way to feel the lonesomeness of SCP-001.\n\n\n\nThose with less self-awareness may be promoted via the Dilbert Principle, that incompetent individuals will be promoted until they can no longer do damage. This is a natural organizational self-defense measure as the structure is aware something is wrong, even if none of the participants themselves are able to.\n\n\n\nThe so-called \"Mandela Effect\" arises when the degree to which any given person is out of sync with reality drifts further in their living memory, so that what was true to them once is no longer so. However, this is easily rationalized and is not considered to be damaging except in rare cases.\n\n\n\nAnalysis of social movements derived from SCP-001 was at first limited to immediate interpretation of the Kennedy Assassination, but following disruption of the assassination attempt on Gerald Ford and the subsequent lack of new renewals of blood, the fracturing of collective truth has continued on its path to disintegration.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a>\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0name=rifle|\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0caption=Mannlicher\u2013Carcano allegedly owned and used by Lee Oswald\n\n]]\n\n\n\nWhen a critical mass of knowledge an individual is able to interpret as factual have no connection to reality as defined by physical laws and natural forces, it will frequently cause them to disconnect most of their familial and social relationships. This withdrawal is usually a result of frustration and confusion. They may begin to make new social connections in small networks of those who find that their alternative viewpoints overlap on at least some measures.\n\n\n\nEven in these extreme cases, this does not prevent those with heavily altered viewpoints from carrying out the functions which have become routine. This is more a result of muscle memory, as their will to engage with the wider world is totally broken by their SCP-001 experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ {{Conclusions:}}\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no purpose on speculating who killed President Kennedy. Every guess is correct to someone.\n\n\n\nNobody can see the world the same way as anyone else. That's just the way it is.\n\n\n\nNormalcy is a comfort to those confused by SCP-001, and should be provided whenever possible.\n\n\n\nWe Secure, Contain, and Protect.\n\n\n\n----\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[html]]\n\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n\n@import url(http://d3g0gp89917ko0.cloudfront.net/v--50456838fc8c/common--theme/base/css/style.css);\n\n@import url(http://d3g0gp89917ko0.cloudfront.net/v--50456838fc8c/common--theme/shiny/css/style.css);\n\n@import url(http://05command.wdfiles.com/local--theme/scp-custom-2/style.css);\n\n</style>\n\n\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\nfunction showHide(e)\n\n{\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0var el = document.getElementById(e);\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0if (el.style.display == \"block\") {\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0el.style.display = \"none\";\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0} else {\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0el.style.display = \"block\";\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}\n\n}\n\n</script>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"firstCollapsible\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"showHide('firstText');\">\u00b0\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00b0\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7_\u00b0\u00d7\u00d7\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\u00d7_\u00b0\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00b0\u00b0\u00d7\u00b0_\u00b0\u00d7\u00d7\u00b0\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00b0</a></div>\n\n<div id=\"firstText\" style=\"display: none;\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b><u>Case N\u00b0:** 137718042 John Fitzgerald Kennedy Autopsy Report</u></b>\n\n<b><u>MALE | 46 | WHITE</u></b>\n\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>External Examination: Skin and hair of the President were rigid.
