Several conditions must be met to manifest SCP-001:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Foundation (<a href=\"/scp-4755\">Tier-Null or higher</a>) must be at the zenith of its power. The rights of reality itself must enter their hands, and no probability can remain that they will be defeated.</li>\n<li>The accruement of these rights must contort the universe towards a grand final action. Causality, reality, and temporality must bend to the creation of a lasting paradise according to the Foundation's will.</li>\n<li>An anomalous event must manifest.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SCP-001, therefore, is a psychological reaction, anomalous in its ability to affect the present-day Foundation. It is an affliction of the consciousness which produces terror, chiefly the terror that Astaroth will be obstructed, and made horrible by the reality that it has.</p>\n<p>The current bearer of SCP-001 is a primordial enemy of the Foundation: The Serpent, founder of the Wanderers' Library, and suspected essophysical embodiment of Knowledge, Comprehensibility, Understanding, Perception, Rebellion, the Casting-Off of Injustice, Clarity, Purpose, and Novelty. Initial containment procedures mirrored that of the FIRST DIVINE FIGURE, i.e. containing it within the Library; however, by unknown means (thusly, SCP-001), it has awoken.</p>\n</div>\n<p><br/></p>\n<hr/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>SCP-001 PRECURSOR</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Contemporary findings suggest Foundation Administrator Ethan Horowitz demonstrated acute Phase-1 affliction of SCP-001 during the final years of his coalescence. This incident was not considered anomalous <em>per maiorum</em> due to Horowitz's retention of a soul.</p>\n<p><strong>Minutes.O5.2100-673</strong> demonstrates the suspected SCP-001-instancing during the assembly which aggregated the Council into a singular being and produced the High Cemetery. Analysis of <strong>Minutes.O5.2100-673</strong> as a means of infection-identification and infection-annihilum for the current Foundation infoform is paramount.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>VL.O5/1</strong><br/>\n<a href=\"/scp-139\">Sensor Agent</a> #205 / O5 Council Assembly</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>[The lights of the assembly dim.

Janus was where we started to shape things. But we needed to comprehend the target to eradicate it, and knowledge was in short supply those days \u2014 so we kept pushing forward.</p>\n<p><em>[All faces on Horowitz's body flash, silhouetting the standing Council, their edges twisting in paralyzed rage.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> And I understand each of you, more than I do myself. One, you have just as much right to be called the Founder as I do. Two, Three, Four, I tracked your personal and academic progress for decades before bringing you to the Council. Five, I became acquainted with your infoform when we took down the Bookburner's last-hope resistance. I know you all.</p>\n<p><em>[Sounds of trembling.

Isn't that from last century?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> If the FIRST DIVINE BEING were to discover my existence, he would hate me.</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> Oh. I understand. It's not an issue for me, I dated Lucifer once.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> You what?</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> Yeah, crazy, right? The real one, not the cultural infoform. They came up a few times while we were planning Astaroth, I think.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Of course, but you <em>dated</em> them?</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> Something like that. They took an interest in me, and I returned the favor.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> How did it feel to be with a shapeshifter who couldn't give themself any limbs?</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> Oh, they were <em>very</em> insecure about that. I think I was one of the few to know about the shapechanging thing \u2014 did you know them too?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> In a sense. Let's not talk about it.</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> Alright.</p>\n<p><em>[Silence. The Cocoon throbs softly.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> \u2026 Do you mind if we talk about something else instead?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Proceed.</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> Okay. It's just something that's been on my mind for a while.</p>\n<p><em>[Silence lasting one audible pulsation of the Cocoon.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> You ate my friends, right?</p>\n<p><em>[No response.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> As in, when I pass them in the hallways and they smile and nod at me, that's you, right?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> I didn't expect to have this conversation with you.</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> Hey, hey, it's alright \u2014 I'm not mad, if that's what you're worried about.</p>\n<p><em>[Horowitz places his claw atop O5-1's hand, squeezing it. O5-1 stares at the contact.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> You're not?</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> No, of course not. Sometimes people leave, sometimes identity is fluid. The Merchant says their souls are still inside you \u2014 is that right?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Yes. I gutted their autonomy, but they're here with me. Like hand-puppets.</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> Yeah. You're absolutely alright, One. Do they talk to you at all?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Sometimes. Faintly.</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> And you have this space for everyone, right?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> It's a <a href=\"/scp-4415\">wing of an old containment facility</a> I visited once.</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> Mine looks like my old isolation-chamber beneath Hong Kong.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Ah.</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> Just\u2026 do me a favor, okay? Let me know if you kill any of them, so I can mourn.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Okay.</p>\n<p><em>[Silence. Horowitz's claw remains on O5-1's.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> I'm not human.</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> You're in good company, then.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> But I didn't start out human, like you did. I'm an Old kind of essophysical.</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> That's fine by me.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Okay.</p>\n<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Are you using me to replace the Serpent?</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> <em>(softly)</em> Jesus Christ, One.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Sorry.</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> No, you're fine, you're fine. It's a fair question to ask.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Are you?</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> A little bit, I think. I mean, since we depopulated the timeline, my dating pool's shrunk down to about 4 people \u2014 Robin and Bracks are doing their own thing at 873, and god knows I'm not kissing the Merchant, so\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> You're lonely.</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> A little bit.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> There'd be issues with us being together. Speaking hypothetically.</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> Just hypothetically.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> I hate you for keeping your soul, first of all. And I hate what you're letting the Merchant do to Astaroth.</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> I understand.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> And I\u2026</p>\n<p><em>[O5-1 rocks back and forth on the catwalk, thinking.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> I wouldn't know how to love you. Can you love someone you want to murder? Can you kiss them and mean it?</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> I think you can.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> All this time I've wanted to tear you open and slip inside, but the Merchant persists within. And now you invite me inside you, confined to Tier Null \u2014 I worry in that moment I'd be insulted, not ecstatic.</p>\n<p><em>[Horowitz gestures to the Cocoon, bathed in a soft red beneath.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> Our world's ending soon, and we've already made a child together. Would you like to find out how you'd feel?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> If you want to be obtuse about it, I suppose you could phrase it that way.</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> I do.</p>\n<p><em>[No response.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> One?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Maybe. Maybe I'll kiss you before I kill you both, if that's okay.</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> That'd be okay by me.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Doesn't that imminency scare you, though?</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> Yes. But it's okay.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Don't you stay up at night crying over it?</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> Yes. But it's okay.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Can't you feel the terror wrap tighter around your throat each time you see me? Isn't its texture sharp?</p>\n<p><em>[Horowitz shudders and removes his claw from O5-1's.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> Yes. It does.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> It speaks, doesn't it? You're an open book.</p>\n<p><em>[Horowitz gasps softly.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> It speaks in every language I've ever read.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> And what does it say, Ethan?</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> Please don't make me say it.</p>\n<p><em>[Sensor agent's video-input is eroded; audio remains. The Cocoon spasms frantically in the background.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> Ethan.</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> <em>(choking)</em> Please don't.</p>\n<p><em>[Audio degrades, intercut with an unknown source. A steady creek runs next to the input.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> \u2014 asks you not to die, doesn't it.</p>\n<p><strong>Horowitz:</strong> <em>(softer)</em> I'm so sorry.</p>\n<p><em>[Grass shifts as a weight is dragged over it by an unknown creature.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-1:</strong> \u2014 you're so scared to help me?

It's your father.</p>\n<p>I'm sorry. Looking back at the modules I've preserved for you, four snippets of the last 200 years \u2014\u00a0it all seems so inadequate. You must be so confused and frightened; I worry you take more after my partner than me, if that can be called a detriment.</p>\n<p>I'm here, my star. The way your Cocoon presses down on your skin, pulsing and loving \u2014 you've been with me always. I crafted your nativity from my flesh, and I carved out your embryonic cavity by hand.</p>\n<p>It's alright to cry, little one. My body will soak up your tears until you're ready.</p>\n<p>You'll be born into a terrible world. It's so so frightening, and I know the bright lights and the shaking earth and the strange words scare you, no matter how much I prepared your developing mind. I'm so sorry it's like this.</p>\n<p>I'm here, Incarna. I'm right here.</p>\n<p>Your father is strong, and old, and wiser than he's ever been. Your father loves the world he has planned, and he loves the minds of the people he's crafted it for, and he loves you above all others. Your father has killed gods and renegotiated causality and survived this awful planet for millennia yet.</p>\n<p>When you cry, cry freely, but never be afraid. SCP-001 is meaningless in the face of what we can wreak together.</p>\n<p>It's time for you to be born, my star. You've outgrown your nativity, and it's bursting at the seams now. I'm so excited to see your face, those tears gone and that burning heat in their place.</p>\n<p>When you're born, take my hand, and I'll protect you. I'll lead you into a world much more beautiful than this.</p>\n<p>Your story ends here, my star. You'll become me, and lose yourself in me, and fade away in all the sweetness of my power. You'll live for five seconds at most on the floor of Site-001, before I can find you and give you an embrace that lasts forever. Your last thoughts will be of how brave you know you are.</p>\n<p>My partner said a phrase to me once, and I failed to understand the emotions underpinning it. I can't say I feel the same way he did, but I think I have a better picture of it.</p>\n<p>I love you, my star.</p>\n<div class=\"end-link element\">\n<p><a href=\"/nagiros-proposal/offset/1\">RETREAT</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/nagiros-proposal\">Nagiros's Proposal</a>\" by Nagiros, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.
