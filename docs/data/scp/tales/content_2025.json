High, whitewashed walls lined with pillars and neat blue shutters for the windows smiled at him as he inched the clanking van emblazoned with the words SAFE CLEANUP PROFESSIONALS down the driveway in the early morning sun.</p>\n<p>Apparently, Mr. Fernand was a gourmand who hosted parties around town that often left quite a mess \u2014 a mess that only the Foundation was willing to clean up. His mentor, Dee, had told him all the new guys had to do it at least once. Beau didn't mind. If Mr. Fernand hung out in fancy houses like this, he'd clean with a smile on his face. Here, in the wealthy suburbs of Pierre, the stillness of <em>some</em> isolation blocked out the noise from the world outside. It was truly peaceful and as Beau approached the front door, he found himself smiling.</p>\n<p>As Beau ascended the stairs to the door on the chilly morning, he noticed it stood slightly ajar. He froze, staring for a second, wondering why anyone would be so silly. It was freezing and all this cold air wasn't going to be good for a person. At least, that's what his gran had told him. Getting closer, he couldn't help but notice the red fingerprints smeared on the door. He peered at them closely, wondering what it was going to take to get that off.</p>\n<p>After a second of considering the problem in front of him, he realised he was being watched from deeper in the house. A looming shadow from the top of the stairs peered down at him and Beau took it as his cue.</p>\n<p>\"Hello?\" Beau said uncertainly. \"This is Beau from the cleaning agency. SCP - Cleanliness Guaranteed!\"</p>\n<p>Thundering footsteps approached the door hurriedly and Beau's stomach knotted, waiting for him to be told he had the wrong house and that he was going to get melted by an old god if he didn't leave immediately. As the door swung open, though, Mr. Fernand beamed down at him from his towering full height. His wide, lopsided mouth approximated a smile, a smile Beau couldn't help but return. Happy clients were always a joy, especially if they were smiling before he even started.</p>\n<p>\"My good friend!\" Mr. Fernand spoke in reedy, heavily-accented English and stood back to let him into the entrance hall. It was a little cramped, but the light from the window above the door bathed the room in a welcoming warmth. The smudges on the floor were going to be a nightmare to deal with, but he was getting the idea it was the least of his worries. \"It is so good of you to come out on such short notice. Usually I schedule things more comfortably, but last night's affair was so short notice, I didn't have a chance to set anything up with the agency. Thank you so much for your time.\"</p>\n<p>\"Not at all!\" Beau chuckled. \"This is way better than the whale my colleagues have to go scrape up this morning. A dinner party, I can deal with.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's more the prep for the dinner party that needs to get cleaned up,\" Mr. Fernand explained, indicating for Beau to follow as he disappeared into the adjoining living room. \"We had venison and I was preparing the elk and let's just say it got messy. The garage and dining room are going to need some proper work. Don't mind the smudges. There was quite a sticky basting sauce.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's not a problem. It's what I'm here for. You'll just need to show me the area of biggest concern for you right now.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sure, sure!\" said Mr. Fernand. \"I'll be happy to.\"</p>\n<p>\"Also, may I say, nice cravat?\" Beau said, his eye catching another broad smear along a wall.</p>\n<p>\"Oh! You like it? It was a gift from the Prince of Venezuela! We met last week for his birthday and he just handed it to me. What was I to do, say no?\" Mr. Fernand tutted. \"Of course, not.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, that you're totally right. You can't look a gift like that in the mouth. The Prince would have been angry.\"</p>\n<p>Mr. Fernand didn't stop nattering about the Prince as he led the way through the elegant home. Beau was there to work though, so as much as he was getting lost in the tales Fernand was telling, he made sure to keep scanning the space for marks. There were a lot of them. Fernand's guests, whoever they were, had thoroughly enjoyed their dinner, it seemed.</p>\n<p>A loud thud from upstairs stopped them in their tracks. Mr. Fernand's eyes shot towards the staircase, his ear cocked, listening closely.</p>\n<p>\"Is everything okay?\" Beau asked.</p>\n<p>\"Yes. The dog is just being naughty again.\" Fernand said, his expression relaxing before he slowly nodded and carried on leading the way, satisfied the dog had gone quiet.</p>\n<p>\"What breed are they?\"</p>\n<p>\"Chihuahua,\" said Fernand and signaled for Beau to follow. \"Come. I'll show you where the party starts.\"</p>\n<p>Beau dutifully followed, but he was pretty sure he was getting the idea of what waited for him in the garage from last night's debris scattered about. The kitchen was a mess of blood and viscera \u2014 looked like lungs, to be specific \u2014 marring the sink, stove and counter space. Fernand, to his credit, seemed at least a little embarrassed at the state of the place and Beau wondered if he'd need to call in Dee to help with this one. It was still early, he reminded himself; there would be enough time.</p>\n<p>\"So as part of my show for the guests, I start in here,\" Fernand said, leading the way into the wide garage down a path lined with flowerbeds waiting for spring. \"This is where I gut and clean the animal for the guests. Of course, I keep the killing of the animal for before. It becomes problematic to serve dinner once your guests are emotionally invested in the meal, so to speak.\"</p>\n<p>\"Whoa!\" said Beau as he stepped in to find yet more viscera and blood centered around a stainless steel hook hanging in the center of the room. Unlike the kitchen, there was no control to this mess. Somehow, Fernand had got bits of his pre-cooked dinner on the roof, on the walls and on the floor. \"This is so interactive!\"</p>\n<p>\"You understand!\" Fernand clapped his hands together, delighted. \"I honestly just like putting on a show for my guests and having them choose the parts they'll be eating draws them so much closer to the experience, don't you think?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, that sounds pretty immersive, alright!\" Beau smiled, turning to regard the garage. \"I'm going to need to get started, though. It wasn't just your guests that were immersed last night.\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course! Of course! Let me get out of your way! If you need anything, anything at all, I'm just upstairs.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thanks a lot! And it's just in here, the kitchen and dining room, right?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh yes, the housekeeper comes on Monday, but there's just no way I was going to call her in for this,\" he said and a grin spread across his face. \"She doesn't quite have the stomach for my parties.\"</p>\n<p>A long silence hung between them as Fernand's eyes traced lines across Beau's face. But Beau quickly began to feel the weight of his backpack and dumped it on the ground and brightly said, \"Well, I better get to work!\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>In the words of Mister Fritz Diedrich Williams, Administrator of the Safe Cleanup Professionals Foundation, \"An SCProfessional's best friend is soap, water and <em>elbow grease!</em> Get scrubbing.\"</p>\n<p>So that's what Beau did. He took a quick sweep of the mess of the house and gathered what he could. Fortunately, Mr. Fernand had put most of the leftovers away already, and Beau had to admit, the crackling looked pretty good. Here and there, the streaks of a cloth made from a shirt that now sat crusted and dried on the edge of the sink told Beau that Mr. Fernand had probably tried to clean up himself before giving up. He couldn't help but chuckle. Some people just needed that extra bit of help, and from how hard Fernand was clenching his jaw, this was all probably pretty overwhelming for him.</p>\n<p>\"Eat shit, Dee,\" he said, dropping the last of some bones, marrow sucked clean, into the trash and heading for the oozing lungs in the sink. \"This is way better than whale clean-up.\"</p>\n<p>He clapped his hands free of dust and sticky sinew over the trashcan and took a deep breath before heading back to the van. The pressure hose was his favourite part and the set-up would take a minute. Of course, part of that set-up meant disappearing behind the garage to smoke a joint. There was no way he was going to be away from management's eyes and <em>not</em> have some fun. Besides, the garage was an abattoir after Fernand's performance art and getting stoned would only help him appreciate it more.</p>\n<p>Dee's weed harshed his throat more than he liked, but it was weed in South Dakota, so he really didn't have high expectations. He knew better than to have expectations at all. He'd learned the hard way.</p>\n<p>With a smile on his face and <em>Paper Planes</em> blaring in his ears, Beau set to work. SCP didn't do much fancy in the way of chemicals, from what he could tell. It really was just elbow grease and soap, he was pretty sure. He did get to meet interesting people like Mr. Fernand and knowing that werewolves actually <em>did</em> exist was pretty cool. Then again, he'd kind of always known it, but it was like a war on the other side of the world \u2014 out of sight, out of mind.</p>\n<p>The rhythmic scrape of the broom's hard bristles slowly scrubbed away Fernand's theatrics from the night before as the sun climbed higher in the sky. Beau had worked up a firm sweat despite the winter cold and was taking a break round back with more of his joint when a shadow from the house caught his attention.</p>\n<p>\"Shit!\" He hissed, stubbing the roach dead on the bottom of his shoe, trying to exhale what he could. He was confident Fernand wouldn't smell anything as he clambered out from behind the garage. \"Mr. Fernand, I'm so sorry! I was just taking a look out back to see if that may need attention. You know we have wonderful gardening services, too?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'll keep that in mind for the spring!\" Fernand said cheerily, casting his eyes towards the gaping maw of the garage and nodding. \"You're making very good progress. Fritz sure knows how to hire.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, but I just think the mess was pretty controlled, honestly.\" He wasn't a good liar, but what else was there to say? He didn't take compliments well. \"Just needs some elbow grease. I hope you don't mind, I moved the freezer. There was blood behind it that I wanted to get out.\"</p>\n<p>\"You moved the freezer?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, I'm pretty good at moving things.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see.\" Fernand's eyes moved between the freezer and Beau for a few seconds before he smiled widely again. \"That's wonderful news! You're very thorough and that is honestly so appreciated. Not enough people take pride in their work these days and it's that kind of dedication that will carry you far young man!\"</p>\n<p>\"You're too kind.\"</p>\n<p>\"Would you like some lemonade? All this work won't be good for you without a refreshment!\"</p>\n<p>\"That'd be \u2014\" A crash came from the nearby second floor window followed immediately by a loud yelp.</p>\n<p>\"That darn dog!\" Fernand snarled and then he set off with urgent steps towards the house before chiming over his shoulder. \"I'll be right back with your lemonade!\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you!\"</p>\n<p>Beau chuckled as he watched the behemoth of a man disappear into the house. He was busy putting his earphones back in, when suddenly a piercing shriek cut through the air from the house. Beau's head swiveled in the direction of the noise and he saw through the open window as Fernand stared down at a flailing mass of hair jittering from just below the window sill. Obviously his dog was quite excitable. Cold fury crossed Fernand's face and just as he looked like he was about to erupt, he saw Beau watching.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Beau! I'm so sorry,\" he cried from through the window, stepping around the agitated animal. \"My dog seems to have gone potty on my rug. I'll have to handle this before I bring you that lemonade, but if you're really quite thirsty you can help yourself to some in the refrigerator.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sure thing, Mr. Fernand! Do you need help with that mess? It's kind of what I'm here for.\"</p>\n<p>\"No, no!\" Fernand said, hastily. \"You just listen to your music and keep busy there or you'll never get finished. It's just a small mess. I can handle this.\"</p>\n<p>Without another word, Fernand stepped back and drew the curtains closed with a flourish, which, Beau thought as he put his earphones back in, wasn't going to help with the smell. Especially considering how big that chihuahua was.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The dining room wasn't as bad as it could have been, Beau reckoned. If the prep areas were abattoirs, he had half expected the dining room to have food in places he didn't know were places. One thing he was worried about though was the piece of <em>something</em> that had somehow hit the roof and stayed there. He'd need to get that down, but that was a worry for later and so he turned his attention to the kitchen floors. With Single Ladies on repeat, he set to work.</p>\n<p>Mr. Fernand never did come back with that lemonade, but Beau just laughed it off. He was probably having a fit over some dog shit on some too-expensive rug. Thank God the downstairs had wooden floors. He could stomach some of the gross things that the SCProfessionals had to deal with, but fighting to get blood out of a carpet was just a nightmare no matter how you approached it. And Mr. Fernand's obviously expensive taste told Beau that in this house, he was more likely to destroy a rug by cleaning it than anything else.</p>\n<p>He'd been surprised to find wealth like this in Pierre. To be honest he'd been surprised to find anything in Pierre, South Dakota, at all. After his mom forged a path here with a boyfriend who left her a few weeks later and with his own dreams of living in L.A. just refusing to materialize, there hadn't been much choice but to pack up and head north.</p>\n<p>Now here he was, more steadily employed than most of his friends back in Philadelphia but with far less prospects. Proven, he realized, by the fact that he was currently wrestling a large bone out from behind a cabinet in the dining room. Like much of what he'd seen, how it got there was a mystery and from the size of Mr. Fernand, he could only assume his aggressive eating was a persistent threat to the surrounding environment. Somehow this bone (was that a femur?) was lodged between the leg of the heavy wooden cabinet and the wall. It <em>wasn't</em> coming loose.</p>\n<p>\"How the fuck\u2026\" Beau mumbled and he squatted next to the cabinet, gripping the bottom rim with his fingers barely an inch from the floor. Then with well-practiced patience and the fear of throwing his back out sitting on his shoulder, he lifted.</p>\n<p>It took a second of nothing happening before finally he felt that shift that told him he'd won. Just a few centimeters was all he needed. He slowly brought himself to his full height, edging upward bit-by-bit, till he heard the clatter of the bone coming loose. He aimed a few frantic kicks in the direction of the clatter and sent it spinning out from under the cabinet and under the table. He watched it ricochet for a bit, amused, then he slowly set the cabinet down again so he could go retrieve his find.</p>\n<p>The bone was quite large, which was probably why he thought it was a femur, but then he had to ask if elks had femurs? They probably did, but were they this big? How big was an elk? He inspected the bone more closely, seeing the meat had been cleanly stripped from it and it had been gnawed on. He froze.</p>\n<p>Why were these bite marks so blunt? These didn't look like they were made by dog's teeth. Unless\u2026</p>\n<p>\"Hello, Beau!\" Mr. Fernand's voice chimed, announcing his entry. He carried a silver tray, tiny in his massive hand, laden with two glasses and a jug of lemonade. \"I see you didn't have any lemonade! You should have helped yourself. I'm so sorry I took so long, but my little baby just went poopy all over and I had to clean it up.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, it's no problem!\" Beau said, turning around to find Mr. Fernand standing so close he could smell the sweat mixing with his too-sweet cologne.</p>\n<p>\"What do you have there?\" Mr. Fernand asked through his perpetually gritted teeth. His beady eyes inspected the bone and Beau in turn.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, yeah, I found this behind the cabinet.\"</p>\n<p>\"You moved the cabinet?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh! Yeah, I'm great at moving stuff.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm glad to hear that, but tell me, you seem confused.\" Mr. Fernand peered closer, almost vivisecting him with his gaze. \"Why's that?\"</p>\n<p>Beau looked from Mr. Fernand to the bone, to the tray of lemonade that looked really welcoming and back to Mr. Fernand and said, \"Well, I just think this isn't an appropriate chew toy for your dog. I don't know if that's rude of me, but I just don't.\"</p>\n<p>\"I-\" Mr. Fernand leaned back to look at Beau from his full height once more, clearly perplexed. \"Why do you say that?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, look,\" Beau pointed to the bite marks. \"Your dog's old, isn't it? It's going poopy on the carpet and it's teeth are super blunt. I think these kinds of chew toys are bad for its gums. It may need a softer chewie.\"</p>\n<p>Mr. Fernand stood silently watching him for a bit, clearly processing what he'd heard. Beau didn't like giving unsolicited advice, but he just didn't like the idea of a dog hurting itself by accident. Mr. Fernand probably didn't even know it was bad for the dog, which was the only reason Beau had said anything. It'd be very inappropriate for him to speak to customers like that normally, but this was for a dog and he wasn't going to apologize for it.</p>\n<p>\"It had never occurred to me,\" Mr. Fernand said meekly, his expression shifting suddenly. \"I'm so sorry. I'll make sure to get that on the list immediately. I'll go get fresh toys when you're done here today.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, you don't need to apologize. You probably didn't even know.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're right, but still, the thought that I've caused my beloved any harm is just too much right now,\" Mr. Fernand held out his hand (more a paw really) and looked suddenly misty-eyed. \"Hand it over. Let me dispose of the foul thing!\"</p>\n<p>Mr. Fernand was taking this very seriously, but if this dramatic Frenchman wanted to atone, who was Beau to stop him? He held the bone out and Fernand snatched it away and disappeared back into the house.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you for the lemonade!\" Beau called after him.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The lemonade really was very good and he kept a glass with him as he worked, making sure the old wood was properly polished and the room properly aired after the smell of barbecue sauce (there was definitely smokey-chipotle sauce at play, too) had pervaded the air so thickly Beau felt he could dip a buffalo wing in it. He still hadn't managed to find a way to get whatever was on the roof off and Mr. Fernand had disappeared so while a ladder was out of the question, he moved on.</p>\n<p>The kitchen was his final task and fortunately, the earlier clean-up had helped a lot. Mr. Fernand had also been very conscientious and not added any major mess to the kitchen at all. So with Secondhand Serenade screaming about falling for someone to keep him company, he began to mop the marble.</p>\n<p>Oddly, while being a cleaning service had never been where he saw himself, this was not unlike what he would have ended up doing at a studio in L.A. so, he liked to see something cosmic in that. Each stroke of the mop was pretty therapeutic too. In the garage, he'd worked in short, quick strokes, scrubbing the blood out of the concrete with frenetic vigour.</p>\n<p>Here, his strokes were long and firm, almost languidly heavy, drawing blood and worse off the tiles and making them sparkle more and more as he went. The dishes had already run in the dishwasher, so making this place shine was the last order of business for the day. As his reflection became more clear in the floor beneath him, Beau couldn't help but smile.</p>\n<p>It was during his return to Single Ladies that he nearly twisted an ankle as he did a double-take watching the mystery-whatever that had been stuck to the adjoining dining room's roof suddenly come loose and plopped down onto the floor.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, cool.\" He said and walked over, pulling his earphones out of his ears. Apparently, all he needed was patience, he thought as he bent down to pick up what he could now see looked like skin with long black hair connected to it. \"Weird.\"</p>\n<p>But another word didn't have a chance to cross his lips as the roof above him suddenly shuddered viciously. He stumbled backwards out of the dining room and leaned on the kitchen counter, staring wide-eyed at the roof, now basically rattling the chandelier loose with each pounding shake. Soon, a loud yell from upstairs snatched Beau's attention and without thinking he set off. Something wasn't right!</p>\n<p>He stormed up the stairs, following the sound of a struggle. The upstairs was uncannily dark, but the passage was clear, so Beau followed the noise swiftly. His feet carried him quickly across the soft carpets and he strained his ears to listen for more details before he arrived. Had someone snuck in while Beau hadn't been paying attention? Mr. Fernand was speaking, babbling in French it seemed, but he couldn't hear him clearly over the sound of crashing furniture and the cries of probably the largest dog in the world.</p>\n<p>Beau approached the room at the end of a long hall where the commotion was coming from. Once again, he found the door ajar and he inched closer as he heard the thrashing from inside, mingled with strings of guttural French. \"Mr. Fernand?\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't come in!\" Mr. Fernand shrieked and Beau froze as the door slammed shut. \"It's not safe!\"</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Fernand, what's that noise? Do you need help?\" Beau leaned closer, trying to hear what was happening. Mr. Fernand was alive, but none of this made sense. If it wasn't safe, why was he still in there then?</p>\n<p>\"No, no! Stay out there. My baby is having a fit. She's just struggling to take her medicine,\" Mr. Fernand's voice strained against the stress of holding back the noisily struggling dog and Beau debated going in. \"It'll be okay. This is normal. Everything is normal!\"</p>\n<p>Beau heard more thudding and then the sudden approached of footsteps. Another crash followed shortly and the door in front of Beau juddered as something was thrown and held against it. It rattled violently for a second and then a single, sudden and sickening crack echoed through the door and all was quiet once again.</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Fernand! Are you okay?\" Beau's voice was loud and clear, just like he'd been taught in drama club, but he never thought he'd be using it for this. \"What was that sound?\"</p>\n<p>\"Massage for my dog,\" Mr. Fernand said and Beau could hear the giant moving toward the door. It swung open and Mr. Fernand towered there with a smile on his reddened face, panting a bit. \"It always calms her down when I click her neck. I'm sorry if I scared you.\"</p>\n<p>Beau looked up at Mr. Fernand's smile and quickly smiled back. \"Nah, it's okay,\" he said with a shrug. \"I was just worried. If you're okay and your dog's okay then that's cool. I can just give you an update on how things are going. I'm almost done, actually.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, yes! Absolutely, please do!\" Mr. Fernand said, gesturing back down the hall so Beau could lead the way.</p>\n<p>\"Sure thing!\" said Beau, but his eyes trailed off for a second before focusing again. \"I'm sorry, I feel so rude. I never got your dog's name.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh!\" Mr. Fernand snickered. \"Tiffany.\"</p>\n<p>Beau processed that for a second then smiled once again. \"That's a real cool name for a dog.\"</p>\n<p>\"Isn't it just?\" Mr. Fernand laughed some more as he stepped into the hall, indicating it was time for them to head downstairs. \"And Beau, would you mind if I arrange short notice for you to come in tomorrow morning, as well?\"</p>\n<p>\"I mean, I don't think the job's gonna take that long.\"</p>\n<p>\"No, no,\" Mr. Fernand smiled his toothy smile. \"I've decided to host another impromptu soiree.\"</p>\n<p>Beau blinked for a second and then remembered that whales could take entire days to clean up and he said, \"Sure, thing!

Alright.\"//\n\n\n\n= //\"...\"//\n\n\n\n= //\"Hey, Beau, what's for dinner?\"//\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nBeau wasn't sure what the \"Colonial Revival\" Dee told him to look for was, but as he looked at the latest job location for Customer 082 -- Mr. Fernand -- from the bottom of the driveway, he supposed it had something to do with being rich. High, whitewashed walls lined with pillars and neat blue shutters for the windows smiled at him as he inched the clanking van emblazoned with the words SAFE CLEANUP PROFESSIONALS down the driveway in the early morning sun.\n\n\n\nApparently, Mr. Fernand was a gourmand who hosted parties around town that often left quite a mess -- a mess that only the Foundation was willing to clean up. His mentor, Dee, had told him all the new guys had to do it at least once. Beau didn't mind. If Mr. Fernand hung out in fancy houses like this, he'd clean with a smile on his face. Here, in the wealthy suburbs of Pierre, the stillness of //some// isolation blocked out the noise from the world outside. It was truly peaceful and as Beau approached the front door, he found himself smiling. \n\n\n\nAs Beau ascended the stairs to the door on the chilly morning, he noticed it stood slightly ajar. He froze, staring for a second, wondering why anyone would be so silly. It was freezing and all this cold air wasn't going to be good for a person. At least, that's what his gran had told him. Getting closer, he couldn't help but notice the red fingerprints smeared on the door. He peered at them closely, wondering what it was going to take to get that off.\n\n\n\nAfter a second of considering the problem in front of him, he realised he was being watched from deeper in the house. A looming shadow from the top of the stairs peered down at him and Beau took it as his cue.\n\n\n\n\"Hello?\" Beau said uncertainly. \"This is Beau from the cleaning agency. SCP - Cleanliness Guaranteed!\"\n\n\n\nThundering footsteps approached the door hurriedly and Beau's stomach knotted, waiting for him to be told he had the wrong house and that he was going to get melted by an old god if he didn't leave immediately. As the door swung open, though, Mr. Fernand beamed down at him from his towering full height. His wide, lopsided mouth approximated a smile, a smile Beau couldn't help but return. Happy clients were always a joy, especially if they were smiling before he even started.\n\n\n\n\"My good friend!\" Mr. Fernand spoke in reedy, heavily-accented English and stood back to let him into the entrance hall. It was a little cramped, but the light from the window above the door bathed the room in a welcoming warmth. The smudges on the floor were going to be a nightmare to deal with, but he was getting the idea it was the least of his worries.\u00a0\u00a0\"It is so good of you to come out on such short notice. Usually I schedule things more comfortably, but last night's affair was so short notice, I didn't have a chance to set anything up with the agency. Thank you so much for your time.\"\n\n\n\n\"Not at all!\" Beau chuckled. \"This is way better than the whale my colleagues have to go scrape up this morning. A dinner party, I can deal with.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's more the prep for the dinner party that needs to get cleaned up,\" Mr. Fernand explained, indicating for Beau to follow as he disappeared into the adjoining living room. \"We had venison and I was preparing the elk and let's just say it got messy. The garage and dining room are going to need some proper work. Don't mind the smudges. There was quite a sticky basting sauce.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's not a problem. It's what I'm here for. You'll just need to show me the area of biggest concern for you right now.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sure, sure!\" said Mr. Fernand. \"I'll be happy to.\"\n\n\n\n\"Also, may I say, nice cravat?\" Beau said, his eye catching another broad smear along a wall.\n\n\n\n\"Oh! You like it? It was a gift from the Prince of Venezuela! We met last week for his birthday and he just handed it to me. What was I to do, say no?\" Mr. Fernand tutted. \"Of course, not.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, that you're totally right. You can't look a gift like that in the mouth. The Prince would have been angry.\"\n\n\n\nMr. Fernand didn't stop nattering about the Prince as he led the way through the elegant home. Beau was there to work though, so as much as he was getting lost in the tales Fernand was telling, he made sure to keep scanning the space for marks. There were a lot of them. Fernand's guests, whoever they were, had thoroughly enjoyed their dinner, it seemed. \n\n\n\nA loud thud from upstairs stopped them in their tracks. Mr. Fernand's eyes shot towards the staircase, his ear cocked, listening closely. \n\n\n\n\"Is everything okay?\" Beau asked.\n\n\n\n\"Yes. The dog is just being naughty again.\" Fernand said, his expression relaxing before he slowly nodded and carried on leading the way, satisfied the dog had gone quiet.\n\n\n\n\"What breed are they?\" \n\n\n\n\"Chihuahua,\" said Fernand and signaled for Beau to follow. \"Come. I'll show you where the party starts.\" \n\n\n\nBeau dutifully followed, but he was pretty sure he was getting the idea of what waited for him in the garage from last night's debris scattered about. The kitchen was a mess of blood and viscera -- looked like lungs, to be specific -- marring the sink, stove and counter space. Fernand, to his credit, seemed at least a little embarrassed at the state of the place and Beau wondered if he'd need to call in Dee to help with this one. It was still early, he reminded himself; there would be enough time. \n\n\n\n\"So as part of my show for the guests, I start in here,\" Fernand said, leading the way into the wide garage down a path lined with flowerbeds waiting for spring. \"This is where I gut and clean the animal for the guests. Of course, I keep the killing of the animal for before. It becomes problematic to serve dinner once your guests are emotionally invested in the meal, so to speak.\"\n\n\n\n\"Whoa!\" said Beau as he stepped in to find yet more viscera and blood centered around a stainless steel hook hanging in the center of the room. Unlike the kitchen, there was no control to this mess. Somehow, Fernand had got bits of his pre-cooked dinner on the roof, on the walls and on the floor. \"This is so interactive!\"\n\n\n\n\"You understand!\" Fernand clapped his hands together, delighted. \"I honestly just like putting on a show for my guests and having them choose the parts they'll be eating draws them so much closer to the experience, don't you think?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, that sounds pretty immersive, alright!\" Beau smiled, turning to regard the garage. \"I'm going to need to get started, though. It wasn't just your guests that were immersed last night.\"\n\n\n\n\"Of course! Of course! Let me get out of your way! If you need anything, anything at all, I'm just upstairs.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thanks a lot! And it's just in here, the kitchen and dining room, right?\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh yes, the housekeeper comes on Monday, but there's just no way I was going to call her in for this,\" he said and a grin spread across his face. \"She doesn't quite have the stomach for my parties.\"\n\n\n\nA long silence hung between them as Fernand's eyes traced lines across Beau's face. But Beau quickly began to feel the weight of his backpack and dumped it on the ground and brightly said, \"Well, I better get to work!\"\n\n\n\n------\n\nIn the words of Mister Fritz Diedrich Williams, Administrator of the Safe Cleanup Professionals Foundation, \"An SCProfessional's best friend is soap, water and //elbow grease!// Get scrubbing.\"\n\n\n\nSo that's what Beau did. He took a quick sweep of the mess of the house and gathered what he could. Fortunately, Mr. Fernand had put most of the leftovers away already, and Beau had to admit, the crackling looked pretty good. Here and there, the streaks of a cloth made from a shirt that now sat crusted and dried on the edge of the sink told Beau that Mr. Fernand had probably tried to clean up himself before giving up. He couldn't help but chuckle. Some people just needed that extra bit of help, and from how hard Fernand was clenching his jaw, this was all probably pretty overwhelming for him. \n\n\n\n\"Eat shit, Dee,\" he said, dropping the last of some bones, marrow sucked clean, into the trash and heading for the oozing lungs in the sink. \"This is way better than whale clean-up.\"\n\n\n\nHe clapped his hands free of dust and sticky sinew over the trashcan and took a deep breath before heading back to the van. The pressure hose was his favourite part and the set-up would take a minute. Of course, part of that set-up meant disappearing behind the garage to smoke a joint. There was no way he was going to be away from management's eyes and //not// have some fun. Besides, the garage was an abattoir after Fernand's performance art and getting stoned would only help him appreciate it more.\n\n\n\nDee's weed harshed his throat more than he liked, but it was weed in South Dakota, so he really didn't have high expectations. He knew better than to have expectations at all. He'd learned the hard way.\n\n\n\nWith a smile on his face and //Paper Planes// blaring in his ears, Beau set to work. SCP didn't do much fancy in the way of chemicals, from what he could tell. It really was just elbow grease and soap, he was pretty sure. He did get to meet interesting people like Mr. Fernand and knowing that werewolves actually //did// exist was pretty cool. Then again, he'd kind of always known it, but it was like a war on the other side of the world -- out of sight, out of mind.\n\n\n\nThe rhythmic scrape of the broom's hard bristles slowly scrubbed away Fernand's theatrics from the night before as the sun climbed higher in the sky. Beau had worked up a firm sweat despite the winter cold and was taking a break round back with more of his joint when a shadow from the house caught his attention.\n\n\n\n\"Shit!\" He hissed, stubbing the roach dead on the bottom of his shoe, trying to exhale what he could. He was confident Fernand wouldn't smell anything as he clambered out from behind the garage. \"Mr. Fernand, I'm so sorry! I was just taking a look out back to see if that may need attention. You know we have wonderful gardening services, too?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'll keep that in mind for the spring!\" Fernand said cheerily, casting his eyes towards the gaping maw of the garage and nodding. \"You're making very good progress. Fritz sure knows how to hire.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thank you, but I just think the mess was pretty controlled, honestly.\" He wasn't a good liar, but what else was there to say? He didn't take compliments well. \"Just needs some elbow grease. I hope you don't mind, I moved the freezer. There was blood behind it that I wanted to get out.\"\n\n\n\n\"You moved the freezer?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, I'm pretty good at moving things.\"\n\n\n\n\"I see.\" Fernand's eyes moved between the freezer and Beau for a few seconds before he smiled widely again. \"That's wonderful news! You're very thorough and that is honestly so appreciated. Not enough people take pride in their work these days and it's that kind of dedication that will carry you far young man!\"\n\n\n\n\"You're too kind.\"\n\n\n\n\"Would you like some lemonade? All this work won't be good for you without a refreshment!\"\n\n\n\n\"That'd be --\" A crash came from the nearby second floor window followed immediately by a loud yelp. \n\n\n\n\"That darn dog!\" Fernand snarled and then he set off with urgent steps towards the house before chiming over his shoulder. \"I'll be right back with your lemonade!\"\n\n\n\n\"Thank you!\" \n\n\n\nBeau chuckled as he watched the behemoth of a man disappear into the house. He was busy putting his earphones back in, when suddenly a piercing shriek cut through the air from the house. Beau's head\u00a0\u00a0swiveled in the direction of the noise and he saw through the open window as Fernand stared down at a flailing mass of hair jittering from just below the window sill. Obviously his dog was quite excitable. Cold fury crossed Fernand's face and just as he looked like he was about to erupt, he saw Beau watching. \n\n\n\n\"Oh, Beau! I'm so sorry,\" he cried from through the window, stepping around the agitated animal. \"My dog seems to have gone potty on my rug. I'll have to handle this before I bring you that lemonade, but if you're really quite thirsty you can help yourself to some in the refrigerator.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sure thing, Mr. Fernand! Do you need help with that mess? It's kind of what I'm here for.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, no!\" Fernand said, hastily. \"You just listen to your music and keep busy there or you'll never get finished. It's just a small mess. I can handle this.\"\n\n\n\nWithout another word, Fernand stepped back and drew the curtains closed with a flourish, which, Beau thought as he put his earphones back in, wasn't going to help with the smell. Especially considering how big that chihuahua was.\n\n------\n\n\n\nThe dining room wasn't as bad as it could have been, Beau reckoned. If the prep areas were abattoirs, he had half expected the dining room to have food in places he didn't know were places. One thing he was worried about though was the piece of //something// that had somehow hit the roof and stayed there. He'd need to get that down, but that was a worry for later and so he turned his attention to the kitchen floors. With Single Ladies on repeat, he set to work. \n\n\n\nMr. Fernand never did come back with that lemonade, but Beau just laughed it off. He was probably having a fit over some dog shit on some too-expensive rug. Thank God the downstairs had wooden floors. He could stomach some of the gross things that the SCProfessionals had to deal with, but fighting to get blood out of a carpet was just a nightmare no matter how you approached it. And Mr. Fernand's obviously expensive taste told Beau that in this house, he was more likely to destroy a rug by cleaning it than anything else.\n\n\n\nHe'd been surprised to find wealth like this in Pierre. To be honest he'd been surprised to find anything in Pierre, South Dakota, at all. After his mom forged a path here with a boyfriend who left her a few weeks later and with his own dreams of living in L.A. just refusing to materialize, there hadn't been much choice but to pack up and head north.\n\n\n\nNow here he was, more steadily employed than most of his friends back in Philadelphia but with far less prospects. Proven, he realized, by the fact that he was currently wrestling a large bone out from behind a cabinet in the dining room. Like much of what he'd seen, how it got there was a mystery and from the size of Mr. Fernand, he could only assume his aggressive eating was a persistent threat to the surrounding environment. Somehow this bone (was that a femur?) was lodged between the leg of the heavy wooden cabinet and the wall. It //wasn't// coming loose.\n\n\n\n\"How the fuck...\" Beau mumbled and he squatted next to the cabinet, gripping the bottom rim with his fingers barely an inch from the floor. Then with well-practiced patience and the fear of throwing his back out sitting on his shoulder, he lifted. \n\n\n\nIt took a second of nothing happening before finally he felt that shift that told him he'd won. Just a few centimeters was all he needed. He slowly brought himself to his full height, edging upward bit-by-bit, till he heard the clatter of the bone coming loose. He aimed a few frantic kicks in the direction of the clatter and sent it spinning out from under the cabinet and under the table. He watched it ricochet for a bit, amused, then he slowly set the cabinet down again so he could go retrieve his find.\n\n\n\nThe bone was quite large, which was probably why he thought it was a femur, but then he had to ask if elks had femurs? They probably did, but were they this big? How big was an elk? He inspected the bone more closely, seeing the meat had been cleanly stripped from it and it had been gnawed on. He froze. \n\n\n\nWhy were these bite marks so blunt? These didn't look like they were made by dog's teeth. Unless... \n\n\n\n\"Hello, Beau!\" Mr. Fernand's voice chimed, announcing his entry. He carried a silver tray, tiny in his massive hand, laden with two glasses and a jug of lemonade. \"I see you didn't have any lemonade! You should have helped yourself. I'm so sorry I took so long, but my little baby just went poopy all over and I had to clean it up.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, it's no problem!\" Beau said, turning around to find Mr. Fernand standing so close he could smell the sweat mixing with his too-sweet cologne. \n\n\n\n\"What do you have there?\" Mr. Fernand asked through his perpetually gritted teeth. His beady eyes inspected the bone and Beau in turn.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, yeah, I found this behind the cabinet.\"\n\n\n\n\"You moved the cabinet?\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh! Yeah, I'm great at moving stuff.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm glad to hear that, but tell me, you seem confused.\" Mr. Fernand peered closer, almost vivisecting him with his gaze. \"Why's that?\"\n\n\n\nBeau looked from Mr. Fernand to the bone, to the tray of lemonade that looked really welcoming and back to Mr. Fernand and said, \"Well, I just think this isn't an appropriate chew toy for your dog. I don't know if that's rude of me, but I just don't.\"\n\n\n\n\"I-\" Mr. Fernand leaned back to look at Beau from his full height once more, clearly perplexed. \"Why do you say that?\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, look,\" Beau pointed to the bite marks. \"Your dog's old, isn't it? It's going poopy on the carpet and it's teeth are super blunt. I think these kinds of chew toys are bad for its gums. It may need a softer chewie.\"\n\n\n\nMr. Fernand stood silently watching him for a bit, clearly processing what he'd heard. Beau didn't like giving unsolicited advice, but he just didn't like the idea of a dog hurting itself by accident. Mr. Fernand probably didn't even know it was bad for the dog, which was the only reason Beau had said anything. It'd be very inappropriate for him to speak to customers like that normally, but this was for a dog and he wasn't going to apologize for it.\n\n\n\n\"It had never occurred to me,\" Mr. Fernand said meekly, his expression shifting suddenly. \"I'm so sorry. I'll make sure to get that on the list immediately. I'll go get fresh toys when you're done here today.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, you don't need to apologize. You probably didn't even know.\"\n\n\n\n\"You're right, but still, the thought that I've caused my beloved any harm is just too much right now,\" Mr. Fernand held out his hand (more a paw really) and looked suddenly misty-eyed. \"Hand it over. Let me dispose of the foul thing!\" \n\n\n\nMr. Fernand was taking this very seriously, but if this dramatic Frenchman wanted to atone, who was Beau to stop him? He held the bone out and Fernand snatched it away and disappeared back into the house. \n\n\n\n\"Thank you for the lemonade!\" Beau called after him.\n\n------\n\n\n\nThe lemonade really was very good and he kept a glass with him as he worked, making sure the old wood was properly polished and the room properly aired after the smell of barbecue sauce (there was definitely smokey-chipotle sauce at play, too) had pervaded the air so thickly Beau felt he could dip a buffalo wing in it. He still hadn't managed to find a way to get whatever was on the roof off and Mr. Fernand had disappeared so while a ladder was out of the question, he moved on.\n\n\n\nThe kitchen was his final task and fortunately, the earlier clean-up had helped a lot. Mr. Fernand had also been very conscientious and not added any major mess to the kitchen at all. So with Secondhand Serenade screaming about falling for someone to keep him company, he began to mop the marble.\n\n\n\nOddly, while being a cleaning service had never been where he saw himself, this was not unlike what he would have ended up doing at a studio in L.A. so, he liked to see something cosmic in that. Each stroke of the mop was pretty therapeutic too. In the garage, he'd worked in short, quick strokes, scrubbing the blood out of the concrete with frenetic vigour. \n\n\n\nHere, his strokes were long and firm, almost languidly heavy, drawing blood and worse off the tiles and making them sparkle more and more as he went. The dishes had already run in the dishwasher, so making this place shine was the last order of business for the day. As his reflection became more clear in the floor beneath him, Beau couldn't help but smile.\n\n\n\nIt was during his return to Single Ladies that he nearly twisted an ankle as he did a double-take watching the mystery-whatever that had been stuck to the adjoining dining room's roof suddenly come loose and plopped down onto the floor. \n\n\n\n\"Oh, cool.\" He said and walked over, pulling his earphones out of his ears. Apparently, all he needed was patience, he thought as he bent down to pick up what he could now see looked like skin with long black hair connected to it. \"Weird.\"\n\n\n\nBut another word didn't have a chance to cross his lips as the roof above him suddenly shuddered viciously. He stumbled backwards out of the dining room and leaned on the kitchen counter, staring wide-eyed at the roof, now basically rattling the chandelier loose with each pounding shake. Soon, a loud yell from upstairs snatched Beau's attention and without thinking he set off. Something wasn't right!\n\n\n\nHe stormed up the stairs, following the sound of a struggle. The upstairs was uncannily dark, but the passage was clear, so Beau followed the noise swiftly. His feet carried him quickly across the soft carpets and he strained his ears to listen for more details before he arrived. Had someone snuck in while Beau hadn't been paying attention? Mr. Fernand was speaking, babbling in French it seemed, but he couldn't hear him clearly over the sound of crashing furniture and the cries of probably the largest dog in the world.\n\n\n\nBeau approached the room at the end of a long hall where the commotion was coming from. Once again, he found the door ajar and he inched closer as he heard the thrashing from inside, mingled with strings of guttural French. \"Mr. Fernand?\"\n\n\n\n\"Don't come in!\" Mr. Fernand shrieked and Beau froze as the door slammed shut. \"It's not safe!\"\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Fernand, what's that noise? Do you need help?\" Beau leaned closer, trying to hear what was happening. Mr. Fernand was alive, but none of this made sense. If it wasn't safe, why was he still in there then?\n\n\n\n\"No, no! Stay out there. My baby is having a fit. She's just struggling to take her medicine,\" Mr. Fernand's voice strained against the stress of holding back the noisily struggling dog and Beau debated going in. \"It'll be okay. This is normal. Everything is normal!\"\n\n\n\nBeau heard more thudding and then the sudden approached of footsteps. Another crash followed shortly and the door in front of Beau juddered as something was thrown and held against it. It rattled violently for a second and then a single, sudden and sickening crack echoed through the door and all was quiet once again.\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Fernand! Are you okay?\" Beau's voice was loud and clear, just like he'd been taught in drama club, but he never thought he'd be using it for this. \"What was that sound?\"\n\n\n\n\"Massage for my dog,\" Mr. Fernand said and Beau could hear the giant moving toward the door. It swung open and Mr. Fernand towered there with a smile on his reddened face, panting a bit. \"It always calms her down when I click her neck. I'm sorry if I scared you.\"\n\n\n\nBeau looked up at Mr. Fernand's smile and quickly smiled back. \"Nah, it's okay,\" he said with a shrug. \"I was just worried. If you're okay and your dog's okay then that's cool. I can just give you an update on how things are going. I'm almost done, actually.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, yes! Absolutely, please do!\" Mr. Fernand said, gesturing back down the hall so Beau could lead the way.\n\n\n\n\"Sure thing!\" said Beau, but his eyes trailed off for a second before focusing again. \"I'm sorry, I feel so rude. I never got your dog's name.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh!\" Mr. Fernand snickered. \"Tiffany.\"\n\n\n\nBeau processed that for a second then smiled once again. \"That's a real cool name for a dog.\"\n\n\n\n\"Isn't it just?\" Mr. Fernand laughed some more as he stepped into the hall, indicating it was time for them to head downstairs. \"And Beau, would you mind if I arrange short notice for you to come in tomorrow morning, as well?\"\n\n\n\n\"I mean, I don't think the job's gonna take that long.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, no,\" Mr. Fernand smiled his toothy smile. \"I've decided to host another impromptu soiree.\"\n\n\n\nBeau blinked for a second and then remembered that whales could take entire days to clean up and he said, \"Sure, thing! I'll call the boss myself! Now, you'll see I've actually made some good progress and I've got some products to recommend to keep your silver looking right.\"\n\n\n\n\"You can tell me all about it over sandwiches. I have some lovely cold-cuts we can have!\"\n\n\n\n\"That's very kind, but I'm actually watching what I eat,\" Beau said, looking over his shoulder. \"I'm trying to get //ripped// so I only eat at certain times.\"\n\n\n\nMr. Fernand sighed and smiled gently back at him, \"Your loss, but I really should have you for dinner sometime.\"\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n= //\"Caleb, don't be mad --\"//\n\n\n\n= //\"Beau, you said you were gonna bring pizza.

Maybe if he went to mass more and stopped smoking as much, but alas, it was too late now.</p>\n<p>He sighed, finishing packing his blunt and bringing it up to his lips. He looked around for the shitty BIC lighter he had bought from the dispensary earlier, finding it behind his keyboard. Moments later, the blunt was lit and he was taking a deep drag from it.

In truth, the flame from the blunt was so dull, it was likely to merely singe the carpet beneath him at worst, but again, Jude was as pathetic as he was paranoid. And yet there he was, worried about the flames of hell.</p>\n<p>He exhaled, the smoke leaving his body in one fell swoop. Smoking had always helped him feel more at ease, but as of late, it was turning into something to fill time rather than a tool to relax. As if he deserved to relax. Surely someone as fucked up and evil as him didn't deserve anything more than suffering.</p>\n<p>After all, he had committed murder. The ultimate sin. Paired with his aforementioned sins, he truly felt wicked. He took another drag of his blunt, this time a smaller one. He didn't immediately break out into hacking coughs, so that was a bonus.

He didn't deserve their friendship, much less their admiration. He was just a thirty-something year-old fuck up who spent his entire life stoned to cope with how much of a failure he was.

The mood is grim.</p>\n<p>\u201cShoki failed.\u201d</p>\n<p>The one who speaks first has hands of gold. As he talks, his fingers quietly scrape against each other- <em>skntch skntch skntch</em>- and gleaming slivers fall, tinkling against the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cCause?\u201d</p>\n<p>One of the monitors responds, SCUFFLE filter rendering its voice dull, anonymous, and utterly banal.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a deviation. Someone <em>interfered</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The scraping stops.</p>\n<p>\u201cDamnation. Are we looking at an XK?\u201d</p>\n<p>The woman, thin blonde hair pulled back into a tight knot, clears her throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cThankfully, no, not yet. Forensics says we got lucky. Population density along the crash zone was just below minimum viability. Initial casualty projections-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry to keep you all waiting.\u201d</p>\n<p>Faces turn. A man is in the doorway. There\u2019s soot on his clothes, and his footsteps leave the floor blackened. Not burnt- a careful distinction, that.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne. Good to see you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man takes his seat, brushing ash off of the shoulders of his overcoat, and the others orient towards him, turning in place. It is a round table, this quorum of the Overseers, but it has a head nonetheless.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are, at this moment, theoretically in violation of the Montreal Protocol<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The woman in white lets her glasses drop from shaking fingers. \u201cPENTAGRAM has made overtures, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>One shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot yet. Notice I said <em>theoretically</em>. Although a failure to maintain Shoki is grounds for the nullification of the protections afforded to us under Montreal, that provision assumes that said failure would\u2019ve either resulted in an XK, or in the detonation of nuclear devices over major American population centers. To my knowledge, neither of those events have taken place.\u201d</p>\n<p>O5-6 frowns, golden fingers clenching rigidly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a thin fucking line to rely on, One. Borders on <em>technicality</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI disagree. As I understand it, the situation at the crash site is\u2026 uncertain, but practically amenable. Seven?\u201d</p>\n<p>Heads turn. The woman in white rubs at her temples, hair coming undone.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotentially- potentially yes. At this point, the hellgate should be self-sustaining, diminished but self-sustaining. There couldn\u2019t have been enough souls close enough to the crash site to have immediately allowed for first or second-order traversal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d</p>\n<p>She almost smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, last I checked, the sky isn\u2019t bleeding, so yes. Reasonably certain. At this point it\u2019s still possible for the aperture to be sealed, but it\u2019d take, god- it\u2019d take every mage we have in North America. Me included. The logistical considerations alone-\u201d</p>\n<p>Gold fingers tap against glass, rhythm inscrutable.</p>\n<p>\u201c-and we\u2019d have to be guarded throughout the process. There\u2019s no telling how many lower-grade entities are coming through as we speak, and-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d be willing to authorize usage of the Helian Door.\u201d</p>\n<p>Murmurs rise from the monitors, overlapping atonal voices blending into staticky incomprehension. Seven stops mid-sentence, brushing strands of blonde hair out of her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Six.\u201d</p>\n<p>One steeples his fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cReturning to the subject at hand, it seems to me that we are facing, at the moment, a containment breach. One of significant proportions, yes, but a simple containment breach nonetheless. Part of the status quo- a status quo <em>protected</em> under the Montreal Protocols. I believe that if we act quickly and decisively to resolve this crisis, PENTAGRAM will not pursue annulment.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou cannot be certain.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Impossibly, the interjection cuts through SCUFFLE as a vitriolic hiss. Seven winces, clutching at her head, turning to stare daggers at the offending monitor.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou would trust PENTAGRAM to act in good faith?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would trust PENTAGRAM to act <em>in its own self-interest</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Six laughs, golden fingers running through thinning hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou and I both know that\u2019s almost as bad, One.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see no alternative. Would you have us resort to Ganymede while a hellgate escalates in plain daylight? Turtle up to weather against hypothetical retaliation when a very real threat to our mandate is right there to be dealt with?\u201d</p>\n<p>Six scowls. \u201cI do not like the shape of this. A pitfall at every turn. It stinks of <em>interference</em>.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"president\">\n<p>|&gt;UNCLEAR PROBABILITIES DIVERGENT UNCLEAR</p>\n</div>\n<p>The voice echoes from the walls, resonant. An eighth monitor rises soundlessly from the floor, black and featureless, a column of basalt. It serves no real purpose other than conversational courtesy. The thing it represents no longer has use for such frivolities as <em>perspective</em>. One turns to address it nonetheless, dipping his head politely.</p>\n<p>\u201cThree. Glad you could make it.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"president\">\n<p>|&gt;TWENTY-THREE PERCENT OPERATIONAL CAPACITY PRESENT AND RECORDING</p>\n</div>\n<p>The last man in the room twitches. Copper-corded limbs convulse and dead eyes shift subtly in a chalk-white face, pulled too taut over the skull.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is the opinion of the Counterintelligence Directorate that there has been no significant compromise of deterrence systems concurrent to the present incident.\u201d</p>\n<p>The factotum\u2019s voice is baritonal, deep and gravelly. Seven shifts in her seat uncomfortably.</p>\n<div class=\"president\">\n<p>|&gt;AGREEMENT SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT CONCURRENCE</p>\n</div>\n<p>\u201cThank you, gentlemen. That simplifies matters.\u201d</p>\n<p>One leans forward in his seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI clarify my proposal. The creation of a temporary Amalgamated Task Force with the sole directive of containing the hellgate-\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"president\">\n<p>|&gt;PROVISIONAL SIX ONE SIX DASH THREE</p>\n</div>\n<p>\u201c-yes, thank you, to be directly overseen by Seven. The commendation of all necessary non-garrisoned personnel and logistical assets for this purpose, until such time as containment has been established. Extraordinary Mobilization.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are calling for the expenditure of our entire North American rapid response capability on a single anomaly.\u201d Six scoffs, incredulous.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou of all people should understand how <em>singularly vulnerable</em> of a position that\u2019d put us in.\u201d</p>\n<p>One stands, beginning to pace the room. The monitors turn to follow his movements.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would remind this chamber that the Foundation\u2019s continued existence has always been dependent on remaining, in the eyes of the world, slightly more palatable than the alternative. Part of that is due to our deterrence doctrine, yes, but, I\u2019d like to think a larger part is due to the work that we do, the sacrifices that every person here has made and continues to make towards the cause. We are presented with an opportunity, gentlemen, to once again demonstrate our value- to persevere against the darkness that none other dare to touch.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s emphatic now, gesticulating, in his element.</p>\n<p>A monitor chimes in, corroborating.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt does seem particularly unlikely that PENTAGRAM would arrange for the creation of an active hellgate on American soil solely to fabricate casus belli to act against us. And even so, why <em>now</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy point exactly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Six turns towards One. Blue eyes meet brown, challenging.</p>\n<p>\u201cShall we put it to a vote?\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"dictation\">\n<p>MOTION FOR EXTRAORDINARY MOBILIZATION</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: green\">PASS</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: green\">7</span>-<span style=\"color: red\">4</span> (1 ABST)</p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"dictation\">\n<p>FOUNDATION ORBITAL ASSET NCAVSAT3993 IMAGE OF PROVISIONAL SCP-616-3 TAKEN IN MEEKER TOWNSHIP, COLORADO 1433GMT11292009</p>\n</div>\n\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>11/29/2009</strong><br/>\nMeeker Township, Colorado<br/>\nPopulation: 1,866</p>\n<p>The Foundation\u2019s best fall on Meeker with the luminous gaze of apportated advance teams stalking haunted streets in lethal silence. Grid-squares are secured block by block, chthonic wails silenced by suppressed weaponry and muttered incantations.</p>\n<p>The noose tightens.</p>\n<p>On a whispered signal, the Helian Door hisses open in a plume of superheated gas. Walls of plasma bloom on the outskirts of Meeker, golden gates bright as the inside of the sun disgorging soldiers, vehicles, prefab watchtowers and concertainer.</p>\n<p>Cast in the blood-light of the hellgate\u2019s shadow, they look almost like heroes.</p>\n<p>Above them the sky bleeds and below them the earth distends with horror but they are the Foundation at war. Demons howl and hellfire rains from the scarlet sky in hissing droplets but they are the Foundation at war, and so their fire is steady and their maneuver is swift.</p>\n<p>Walls erupt from the blood-mist, knife edged, topped with concertina wire and spotlights. Hard-helmeted men with blue coveralls and determined expressions drive iron stakes into the flagellated earth as black-kevlar regiments hold the line with tactical sacrament and blessed gunfire mere feet away. There is none of the mechanized brutality of a Coalition fire mission, the esotericism of a Psychotronics intervention, the heedless overkill that is PENTAGRAM\u2019s penchant.</p>\n<p>The perimeter forms, the perimeter holds, and the perimeter expands.</p>\n<p>This is the Foundation at war.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2 id=\"toc1\"><span><span style=\"color: red\">2. UNDER THE GUN</span></span></h2>\n<hr/>\n<p>O5-7 ducks out of the helicopter, brushing thin blonde hair out of her eyes as the dry wind snags at her ponytail. The air stinks, petrochemical reek and gunpowder fumes mixing into an eye-watering miasma that has her retching, coughing into her fist, almost doubling over. Footsteps hurry towards her across the tamped dirt, and a black-gloved hand presses a respirator into her fingers.</p>\n<p>She accepts it gratefully, clipping the mask on over her nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry about the, ah, atmospheric situation, ma\u2019am. The techies say the skip\u2019s mucking with the airflow. Something about environmental resonance.\u201d</p>\n<p>The trooper shuffles apologetically, gas-masked gaze scrupulously avoiding her face. There\u2019s a distinct unease to his stance, and his arm hovers awkwardly at his side, as if unsure whether or not to offer her a hand.</p>\n<p>She gives him a reassuring smile, following him down the makeshift staging ground towards the first of the barricades. Periodically, chattering gunfire cuts through the scarlet smog, followed by echoing, resonant shrieks that linger uncomfortably in the black between her eyes. She grits her teeth, shaking her head irritably.</p>\n<p>The command tent is a buzzing hive of fluttering white coats and blue coveralls punctuated by the shrill screams of power tools and the bassy thrum of thaumoelectric generators. Two guards flank the entrance flap, snapping to attention as she approaches. She takes a moment to shrug off her heavy greatcoat, nodding gratefully as the trooper considerately moves to receive the mass of warded fabric. Stretching her shoulders, she reaches for nonspace with a twist of will, pulling against the air. Laminated white polyester slides into her hand from the gap between atoms.</p>\n<p>Slipping on her labcoat, O5-7 steps into the command post.</p>\n<p>\u201cOVERSEER ON DECK!\u201d</p>\n<p>The shout ripples through the room. A hundred pairs of feet stand at attention, a ring of stoic faces following her every move, encircling her like sunflowers facing the sun. Bile rises in her throat, but Seven bites it back down. She gives them what she hopes is a winning smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cCould I have a word with Commander Jefferson? Everyone else, back to your stations.\u201d</p>\n<p>The room mutedly resumes movement, voices hushed, a hundred pairs of ears straining to grasp at the edict of a demigod, the command of an Overseer. Even the power tools sound sullen, whirring anxiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat would be me, ma\u2019am.\u201d A voice calls from the back of the room, deep and baritonal.</p>\n<p>Seven turns to take his measure. Dark brown eyes set in an alert, clean-shaven face, marred by an impressive scar distorting the corner of his mouth into an exaggerated, downturned scowl. Nondescript Foundation BDUs, ironed crisp, polished boots and a holstered pistol at his hip. She knows the type. She's seen a thousand of him in her tenure, across a dozen different sites and half a hundred task forces.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, she wondered if the Foundation really was cloning people.</p>\n<p>One had never quite given her a straight answer when she\u2019d asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow is the situation on the ground?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jefferson\u2019s face sours.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo be frank? Not great.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a sustained burst of gunfire, followed by a succession of concussive blasts that rattle the tent, as if to punctuate his point. More ephemeral screaming. Seven tries to keep the wince off of her face.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve secured the perimeter, constructed defenses, gotten basic operational infrastructure up and running. The boys from Nu-7 are working on bringing the nuclear contingency online.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hesitates, shoulders slumping slightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to encounter insurmountable logistical issues. They\u2019re coming from the gate at a rate that\u2019s eventually going to outpace our ammunition supply. I\u2019ve had the suppression teams working in shifts since day one, but everyone\u2019s on edge. It feels like we\u2019re going to be overrun.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jefferson meets her gaze fully for the first time.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo be honest, ma\u2019am, I think the men are expecting you to pull a rabbit out of a hat.\u201d</p>\n<p>After a beat, he blanches, quickly looking down. \u201cN-no offense.\u201d Seven notices sudden perspiration gleaming on his forehead and sighs internally.</p>\n<p>\u201cNone taken.\u201d</p>\n<p>The entrance flap rustles. A balding, potbellied man in a disheveled black rubber apron bursts through, scanning the tent apprehensively. Jefferson waves him over.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019d be Doctor Jameson from Beta-77. To my understanding, he and his team have been waiting for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Commander. That\u2019ll be all.\u201d</p>\n<p>He salutes her again, snapping his heels together.</p>\n<p>Seven turns to go, then hesitates. Facing the room, she raises her voice, trying her best to sound authoritative, calm, to project control the way One does so effortlessly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been told that some of you here have been expecting a miracle. The good news is, that is my department. Carry on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her voice sounds wavering, even to her, but the room gives an appreciative cheer nonetheless. Swallowing nausea, Seven follows the doctor out of the tent.</p>\n<p>There is work to be done.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>A demon\u2019s severed head drips orange ichor onto the blue tarping of the lab bench. It\u2019s vaguely selachian, mottled gray skin streaked with phosphorescent blue stripes. Two jagged arcs of obsidian curve from its forehead like antlers, glistening wetly. As Seven watches, serpentine pupils dilate in lidless sockets, swiveling up to look at her. The thing\u2019s mouth twitches.</p>\n<p>Seven slides another silver needle into its skull.</p>\n<p>Jameson stands next to her, bearded face furrowed. Sweat pours off of his bald scalp and runs down his face in perspicuous droplets. Occasionally, he mops at his face with a yellow handkerchief, though it barely seems to help. Seven doesn\u2019t mind. At least he hasn\u2019t tried to salute her yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re uh, pretty sure that the instances coming through the gate are, for all intents and purposes, fully substantiated. If you would let go of the probe, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p>\n<p>Seven nods, stepping back from the desk. Jameson taps rapidly on the keyboard cradled to his chest, then hits enter.</p>\n<p>The lights of the mobile laboratory flicker, the background hum of ventilation fans sputtering to a halt. The demon\u2019s head twitches, eyes rolling back as each of the seven silver spikes buried in its skull flare a brilliant, blinding blue. There is a smell like rotting eggs and abscesses. Seven turns away, sleeve pulled over her mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf that thing had been a normal manifestation, it would've been disintegrated by the disvocation matrix we just pumped into it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The head is still there, faintly steaming, clotted orange ichor leaking slowly from each eye. It no longer twitches. Jameson\u2019s mouth curls with distaste, and he moves to dislodge the silver spikes, sliding each out of the demon\u2019s flesh with a wet squelch.</p>\n<p>Seven nods, comprehending.</p>\n<p>\u201cInstead of being matter from our reality held together by will from the outside, the demon has crossed over fully, body and bowel. The hellgate isn\u2019t just manifesting them. It\u2019s translating them into our dimension.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jameson slides the head into a biowaste crate and sighs, sealing the lid.</p>\n<p>\u201cPrecisely, ma'am. I'm sure you see where the problem is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just seal off the breach. They\u2019d just force their way through, regardless of the warding schema. We actually have to close it altogether.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seven peels off ichor-slick gloves, rubbing her hands together, beginning to pace the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want this laboratory to myself for the next twelve hours. Access to every scrap of data you\u2019ve collected about the hellgate, about Meeker, local geological and thaumaturgic readings. A thaumoelectric generator. As much coffee as can reasonably be had. And a whiteboard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jameson looks up from wiping down the bench, face pale. Seven realizes a slow grin has spread across her face. She lets it sit there until Jameson looks away.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am, uh, O5-7 ma\u2019am, of-of course. Right away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne more thing, Jameson.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBring me more of their <span style=\"color: #b200ed\">heads</span>.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"color: red\">The little things are running.</span></p>\n<p>Asveth Korgaul, twenty-eighth to taste the true blood of the Tree, nineteenth of the Mighty, <span style=\"color: red\">he-who-is-favored-in-murder</span> lifts a head the size of minor moons and sniffs at the bloodsoaked air of Upper Megiddo.

Liquid fire, silky smooth, trickles achingly down his throat. Golden fingers fiddle with the plastic safety cap of the Armageddon Button, flicking it up, then down, up, then down.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not actually a button, of course, more of a switch, really, and truth be told not particularly apocalyptic compared to some of the other ones at his immediate disposal. He sits nestled at the center of Site-01, enshrined in the shining, sterile, utterly secure heart of the Foundation. He is the only living, breathing thing within \u2588\u2588\u2588 kilometers. He is, practically speaking, the loneliest man alive.</p>\n<p>Seven left by apportation thirty minutes after the meeting ended. One had kept him company for a little while longer, gossiping of this and that matter of state, before cheerfully stepping into the fireplace and turning to ash. Off to his bunker in the Mojave no doubt, off to beat gods at dice and host devils for dinner and delegate everything actually important to everyone else.</p>\n<p>Wiping at his mouth, Six reaches for the nearest keyboard.</p>\n<div class=\"elaimal\">\n<p>INITIALIZING O5COM_v14.3 SECURE TELECOM INTERFACE<br/>\nINSTANCE 3455 LOGGED<br/>\nWELCOME, O5-6</p>\n<p>O5-6: Just received hourlies from Meeker.

Old springs, long gone stiff, dig sharply into his back. He winces.</p>\n<p>The damned things were relics, dredged up from the dying days of the Cold War. Their arthritic engines had practically given the pit crew a nervous conniption upon inspection, and traversing the turret for any length of time filled the basket with the agonized screeching of neglected servos. There was a reason Hammer Down hadn\u2019t deployed in force since the eighties: the arsenal beneath Ruby Mountain was practically a boneyard, half of it stolen from other boneyards.</p>\n<p>At least the bushmasters still worked.</p>\n<p>The backline clamors with activity, vast auto-censers vaporizing industrial quantities of frankincense and myrrh over a pyramid of piled ammunition crates as black flocks of conscripted vestry recite tactical sacrament with a fervor comprehensible only to the damned. Gun crews scramble up and down the palisades, skidding into foxholes, rapping atop sigil-touched turrets rotating as one to face the very mouth of Hell, white-hot on their thermals.</p>\n<p>Morris counters up and down the line simultaneously crescendo into ear-splitting screeches that rise into frequencies inaudible, before shorting out altogether in sparking bursts of static.</p>\n<p>Freedman looks towards the burning horizon, swallows his Zyn, and pre-sights the main gun.</p>\n<p>The last belts are loaded, the last hatches are sealed, the last pieces of chewing tobacco spat ignominiously into the rusty earth.</p>\n<p>There is a terrible, breathless, aching silence.</p>\n<p>The earth shifts, boils, shatters.</p>\n<p>\u201cWeapons free.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hell follows.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Asveth Korgaul is close now, so terribly, achingly close. The plain beneath him writhes with a living carpet of the <span style=\"color: red\">lesser</span>, like red water flowing over and under his limbs, biting at adamantite scales, crushed by the millions beneath every quaking step.</p>\n<p>He sees now the reason for their congregation.</p>\n<p>There is a <span style=\"color: red\">tear</span>.</p>\n<p>A small one, a pale bloom of pink stretched against the undersky, a galactic teratoma compressed into a pulsing, wrathful singularity by exquisite agony. It leads, he sees now, it leads to a <span style=\"color: red\">lesser</span> world, already spindled by threads of <span style=\"color: red\">red</span> and black, balanced on the very precipice of <strong>order</strong>.</p>\n<p>He bends his head in supplication to the Wounded Lord of Heaven and his prayer sounds with the thundering chorus of high-altitude thermonuclear detonation, with the hiss of cosmic background radiation, with the cries of children in pain.</p>\n<p>He sheds many of his arms, for the <span style=\"color: red\">lesser</span> world cannot bear them as they are. He sheds his adamantite scales for ones of mere graphene, his supernova claws for ones of base enchantment. He sheds his black crown and places it reverently on the ground, where it immediately begins melting its way down into the crust of Upper Megiddo.</p>\n<p>Naked, supplicant, purified, he ascends towards the undersky upon winds of slaughter.</p>\n<p>His pilgrimage awaits.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: red\">tamarin tesh asham korgath turnal tamarin tesh avashin tomath vaten ela ela ela tamarin tesh</span></p>\n<p>Before him, the <span style=\"color: red\">lesser</span> flee, maddened with terror, and behind him they flock in untold billions. Eagerly, they await their chance to spread the <span style=\"color: red\">good word</span>.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The obsidian <em>khopesh</em> glides through 25\u00a0mm of composite-wrapped steel plating like so much wrapping paper. Sgt Calvin Freedman feels it slice through his plate carrier, hook up into his ribcage, and <em>pull</em>.</p>\n<p>He coughs, a small, surprised noise. His face feels sticky and warm and blood runs down the plastic screen of the FCS display in front of him in black rivulets. Offhandedly, he feels a moment of sympathy for the cleanup crew.</p>\n<p>Golden claws gleam through the gash in the hull, widening the gap in a screech of tortured metal. He coughs again, wetly. Something in his chest pops and deflates.</p>\n<p>A figure stares down at him from the breach, black on red, bipedal, covered with a dense carpet of wriggling tendrils like the underbelly of a millipede. Six insectoid arms grip the edges of the cut, pulling. The side of the Bradley falls away into ribbons of twisted steel.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s grinning at him.</p>\n<p>He grins back.</p>\n<p>Blood-slick fingers reach for the detcord of the claymore mine strapped across his chest, pulling the pin.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Fifteen minutes into the battle sees Commander Lionel Jefferson realize that all is lost.</p>\n<p>The command tent rattles with the blast of the handful of ancient Paladins that consist of the sum total of the Foundation\u2019s artillery corps. Privately, he doubts that even ten times their number would\u2019ve been enough to make a difference.</p>\n<p>If he survived, Jefferson resolves, clenching his teeth, he\u2019d have the Logistics Division lined up against the wall and shot. He\u2019d do it himself if he had to.</p>\n<p>There had simply been too many of them. Sheer volume of bodies had nearly instantaneously overwhelmed the output of the first killzones, a red wave pouring over concertina wire and trenches to slam liquidly against the first set of palisades. Almost half of the Bradleys had been lost in those frantic first minutes, dug-in outside the walls. There simply had been nowhere to retreat them to, not after the primary fallback routes had become entirely inundated by swarms of blue-feathered, multi-headed pangolins that spit acid, ate metal and ran at highway speeds. He\u2019d ordered them abandoned instead, scuttled with blessed thermite and satchel charges, and personally watched from atop the concertainer as the bonfires flared up one by one, each briefly illuminating the scuttling, crawling stream of bodies before snuffing out.</p>\n<p>Not a single crewman had belayed the order.</p>\n<p>Not a single one had made it back behind the walls.</p>\n<p>The emplacement itself would hold for a while longer, at least. He\u2019d ordered the M113s, alongside the remaining Bradleys, up onto dirt ramps, depressing their Vulcans over the palisade to fire point-blank into the horde as they scrabbled and scratched at the base of the walls. Jefferson was confident that they\u2019d manage to keep the demons at bay for as long as the ammo held out.</p>\n<p>By his most generous estimates, they\u2019d last for another half-hour.</p>\n<p>Staring through the blood-mist at his crumbling frontline, Commander Lionel Jefferson comes to the terrible realization that the Montana National Guard genuinely might\u2019ve done better in his position. For the first time in twenty years of honorable service, despair sets in.</p>\n<p>There was only so much you could do with a scalpel, however sharp, when arrayed against an exploding volcano.</p>\n<p>\u201cPriority one is making sure the Overseer makes it out alive. Send five men from my alpha company to the lab. Make sure she\u2019s on the first truck out of here. Start evacuating the backline staff to the minimum viable fallback distance alongside the remaining garrison force. Send anyone left to the front. Ping Overwatch, flag STARFIRE BRAVO NOVA, and tell the nukies to get the bomb ready. We\u2019re going to take out as many of these fuckers-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOVERSEER ON DECK!\u201d</p>\n<p>Through the din, through the artillery, the sounds of slaughter, and the screeching of Hell, those three words cut like a prayer.</p>\n<p>Jefferson turns towards the entrance of the command post.</p>\n<p>O5-7 is standing there, a flock of white coats trailing reverently in her wake, faces cast in supplicant admiration. Her thin blonde hair is unwound, falling around her shoulders in scraggly streams, and she\u2019s smiling.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s nothing nervous about it this time, no hint of uncertainty or doubt. It\u2019s a smile that casts a shadow, balanced on the knife\u2019s edge of wild, unconscious charisma and cackling madness. It\u2019s a smile that cuts like a tungsten rod dropped from orbit.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the smile of one about to do the impossible.</p>\n<p>Against all experience, all rational belief, all smatterings of common sense, Jefferson feels his heart beating with wild hope. His arm is raised in salute. He doesn\u2019t even remember doing it. The tent is quiet. The battle is quiet. Hell itself seems to have gone quiet.</p>\n<p>The Overseer\u2019s command rings out like the edict of a demigod.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to borrow your nuclear bomb.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2 id=\"toc3\"><span><span style=\"color: red\">4.

The earth roils and fractures. Sections of the barricade are brought to ruin, its defenders dismayed, dismounting their vehicles and running for shelter, knowing themselves as ants in a titanomachy. High above, in the upper atmosphere, the air crackles and snaps with thaumoelectric discharge. The wind comes, dry and hot, smelling of ozone and blood. Some of the white-coats drop to their knees, crumpling to the ground like paper dolls. The rest continue the incantation, blinking sweat from bloodshot eyes.

Concertina wire is respooled, foxholes and earthworks concealed and flattened by a small squadron of bulldozers.</p>\n<p>In the end, the hellgate itself proves almost a mercy.

Much of the work of the day was spent mounting and securing the remaining Bradleys atop a series of flatbed haulers departing for the railroad junction at Glenwood Spring under the guise of an Army field exercise, and neither will they be the last. There is a garrison left behind, token perimeter security and a squad of glum-faced researchers who, having drawn short straws, will stay on-site for another three months, monitoring spacetime integrity and any lingering tartarean contamination. Seven attempts a pep talk, reciting the platitudes One bade her memorize by rote. The words feel plastic, artificial, but she sees their backs straighten nonetheless. She walks away before they can attempt a salute.</p>\n<p>Seven stretches out in the mercifully empty backseat of the Humvee, letting out a shuddering breath. Thaumic exhaustion roils beneath her skin, flaring into painful spasms that leave her wincing, rubbing at her arms. She wonders at the lengths Jefferson must have gone to reserve an entire vehicle for her personal use, stifling a guilty smirk as she pictures a squad of grim-faced operators sitting stoically in each other\u2019s laps.</p>\n<p>Her eyes slip shut, just for a moment.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"omalley\">\n<p>Cigarette smoke curls dimly in the blue light, spun into a slow vortex by the ceiling fan.

The Deterrence Doctrine was built to allow for the eventuality of a nuclear contingency being used- there\u2019s still nothing justifying annulment, not on this scale-\u201d</p>\n<p>O5-6 stops mid-stride.</p>\n<p>There is a figure standing in the doorway to the command room, which is impossible, as O5-6 is the only living thing within \u2588\u2588\u2588 kilometers of Site-01. Sunken gray eyes set in pallid flesh braided with cords of sanctic copper stare down at Six.</p>\n<p>There is a slow sensation of simultaneous unravelling and rearrangement, puzzle pieces falling into place like a twisting knife.</p>\n<p>The factotum\u2019s jaw unhinges with a wet tear, revealing the recessed speaker embedded in its throat.</p>\n<p>Six makes a decision that saves his life.</p>\n<p>Stuffing golden fingers into his ears, he grits his teeth and pushes. His eardrums pop, warm blood trickling down the side of his head, just in time to defend against the truly virulent stream of verbal cognitohazards erupting from the corpse-puppet as it lunges at him, pale hands outstretched.</p>\n<p>The impact knocks him to the floor, air rushing from his lungs as the thing wraps icy, implacable fingers around his neck and squeezes. The dead eyes staring back into his own glint with malign consciousness. The factotum doesn\u2019t smile, not with its jaw dangling loosely by copper wire, but there\u2019s an impression of one nonetheless.</p>\n<p>He claws uselessly at dead flesh, golden fingers scraping bloodless rivulets into its cheeks. Blackness creeps into the edges of his vision, his grip slackening. Six feels his pulse thumping in his temple, a pounding echo in his skull.</p>\n<p>Gasping, choking on a mouthful of blood, Six spits in the thing\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>Sulfur, sharp and pungent wafts through the air, mixing the scent of iron. Where his blood splatters against the factotum\u2019s skin, great black strips of flesh crumble, rotting off of the copper scaffolding, spreading inwards. There is a spray of sparks as the disintegration hits something critical. The thing\u2019s grip slackens.</p>\n<p>Six slides the inert factotum off of him, scrabbling on hands and knees towards the central console. Blood fills his mouth, vision gone spotty with distortion. He knows better than to try to breathe. Golden fingers pry open a metal panel from the bottom of the console, revealing a thin metal syringe.</p>\n<p>With the last of his strength, Six injects 20ccs of synthetic Paramecium directly into the side of his neck.</p>\n<p>He feels his eardrums reconstitute, then screams in agony as his shattered throat pushes itself back into position.</p>\n<p>In a voice made raw by reknitting vocal cords, Six gasps into the air.</p>\n<p>\u201cCounterintelligence.

To safeguard American citizenry from Foundation reprisal and additional sub-veil threat organizations. To preserve American paranatural dominance in the face of extraordinary threat to national sovereignty and liberty.</p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>It\u2019s morning in America.</p>\n<p>Mason Gutierrez watches his breath frost onto the inner pane of the guard booth and sighs miserably, rubbing his hands together. It\u2019s always cold in Site-19, doubly so in the surface wards. Drinks would ice over if you left them out overnight, cans of coke would burst, and the water came out of the faucets cold enough to burn when it flowed at all. He\u2019d wear gloves, he ought to wear gloves, half the infirmary was full from frostbite this time of year, but the damned things made keyboards impossible to use.</p>\n<p>He picks up his mug of steaming coffee, wrapping his fingers around it gratefully before taking a small, measured sip. He has to make it last. A refill would mean making the ten minute trek back across the outer perimeter into the barracks, through the driving wind that cut through layers like a knife, that blew gritty snow into your eyes and up your nose, through the cold that left your lips bleeding and chapped.</p>\n<p>There is a flashing red light on the display. Mason sets the cup down, peering cautiously at his monitor. Something is at the vehicle gate.</p>\n<p>Tourists, probably. There were always tourists here, coming up and down the highways across the tundra and they always, always managed to get lost. He accesses the gate camera, wincing as newly warmed fingers clatter against icy keys. Gray screen.</p>\n<p>The bastards on second shift forgot to defrost the lenses, again.</p>\n<p>Shouldering his rifle, Mason presses the yellow caution, just in case, bracing himself before opening the door to the guard booth.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! You folks gotta get outta here! Government prop-!\u201d</p>\n<p>His voice is cut by the sound of steel crumpling like tinsel.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"textbook\">\n<p>Phase 1- Control</p>\n<p>STRATCOM assets will mobilize in force nationwide to take control of major Foundation sites.

Why do you ask?\u201d</p>\n<p>Maria points a shaking finger at the ceaseless gray plain of the Mare Imbrium.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen who the fuck are they?\u201d</p>\n<p>James peers through the tempered glass, then takes a startled step back, face gone pale.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly hell, are those <em>guns</em>?\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"textbook\">\n<p>Phase 2- Capture</p>\n<p>An index of relevant High Value Targets is to be collated and produced by joint initiative of PENTAGRAM and the Directorate of National Intelligence.

The hallway fills with flame, automatic gunfire replaced by shouts of alarm. Cautiously, she levitates a shard of polarized glass around the doorway, wincing as suppressive fire resumes, shattering the makeshift mirror.</p>\n<p>Something small and metal skitters through the doorway, bouncing at her feet. Snapping her fingers, she sends it skittering the other way before ducking behind the wall and plugging her ears. There\u2019s an earsplitting bang.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat one wasn\u2019t a flashbang. I think they\u2019re about done trying to take us alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>She reaches for a pouch on the bandolier strapped across her chest, producing a fistful of bees.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: green\">\u201cFly, my pretties!\u201d</span></p>\n<p>Behind her, the remnants of Sigma-3 cower behind a bookshelf, furiously incanting.

He pulls over to the side of the road, already reaching for his wallet. Deft fingers slide a white priming card into the ID display before he forces an unassuming smile onto his face, rolling down the driver\u2019s side window.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat seems to be-\u201d</p>\n<p>Two gunshots.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"textbook\">\n<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission will halt all transactions pursuant to the following tickers for a period of ten trading days: $SCCP, $PCS, $SNCP, $SCPZ, $SPPC, $SPC.</p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cYou people have nothing on me. <em>Nothing</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Fitzgerald, please understand-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeventeen years of legitimate business, by the book.

Lifeblood flows down the basalt column, into the recesses and grooves of the black room carved by secret order of Ronald Reagan on October 31st, 1986. Around the altar sixteen senators chant the opening paragraph of the Declaration of Independence in High Daevite, interspersed by screaming eagles and a recording of the first bombs falling on Baghdad.</p>\n<p>Three hundred feet beneath the Oval Office, a disembodied black heart beats for the first time in forty years.</p>\n<p>In the skies of Washington, the strongest geomantic warding scheme ever devised flickers into luminous existence.

The overhead lights flicker maddeningly and there\u2019s a great groan of agonized steel as the ventilation fans slowly spin to a halt.</p>\n<p>\u201cSir, I have to ask, at a certain point, does it even matter? I mean-\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a sound like the sky falling atop their heads, a deep whistle followed by a calamitous detonation that sends the room stumbling to the floor, hands clapped over ears. Monitors topple, crashing down in showers of sparks and broken glass. There is a round of muffled cursing. Klaxons blare, and then the fluorescents cut out, replaced after a beat by the red glow of emergency lighting.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure they just dropped a bunker buster on us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPoint taken.\u201d</p>\n<p>Director Richard Xythinien wipes his nose, blood smearing the back of his hand. He pauses for a moment, considering, before reaching into his breast pocket to produce two silver keys.</p>\n<p>\u201cNever thought I\u2019d actually have to go through with this. Even the nuke seemed more likely, looking back. Working for the Foundation thirty years, you get the idea-\u201d</p>\n<p>The room shakes again. One of the supports groans ominously, cracks spiderwebbing the concrete. The director stumbles, then catches himself, shaking his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cSame procedure as detonating the warhead. You know the drill. Both keys turn within twenty seconds or the system freezes, locks us out.\u201d</p>\n<p>He tosses one of the silver keys at Matthews, turning towards the console.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the big one.

There\u2019s a cot and desk bolted into the concrete floor and a fisheye lens gleaming in the corner of the ceiling. It\u2019s an uncomfortably familiar arrangement.</p>\n<p>Seven turns her head, wincing. There\u2019s less pain than she expected: a dim ache in the pit of her stomach coupled to a sense of comprehensive <em>emptiness</em>, and a gnawing hunger grown to proportions beyond simple sensation. Her hands are bound behind her back, and something cool and metal presses loosely around her neck, shifting as she moves her shoulders.</p>\n<p>The walls of the cell shine with a steady sheen of running water, cascading from floor to ceiling in laminar sheets that splash into grates lining the perimeter of the room. The air is heavy with geomancy, aether tainted with the runoff of a dozen cascading wards.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of faint irony.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s familiar with the theory behind the cell. She wrote most of it herself.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a loud thrum that echoes through the cement floor, and the flow trickles to a stop, leaving the walls glistening with moisture. The door to the cell opens, swinging on heavy hinges.</p>\n<p>A woman walks in, flanked by two grim-faced men in plainclothes with assault rifles slung over their shoulders. She holds a briefcase in one hand and a folding chair in the other.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou must realize who I am.\u201d Her voice comes out as a rasping croak.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe do.\u201d</p>\n<p>The woman sets the folding chair down. One of the guards moves to stand in front of the doorway. The other circles behind Seven, rifle raised.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen you realize what utter folly it is to have taken me alive. I am an Overseer of the SCP Foundation. They will come for me. They will find me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The woman takes a seat, one eyebrow arched. She looks faintly unimpressed.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy name is Tabitha Jones. I\u2019m from the State Department. We have a few questions for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seven opens her mouth to respond. Nothing comes out.

The mood is grim. \n\n\n\n\u201cShoki failed.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe one who speaks first has hands of gold. As he talks, his fingers quietly scrape against each other- //skntch skntch skntch//- and gleaming slivers fall, tinkling against the table.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cCause?\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of the monitors responds, SCUFFLE filter rendering its voice dull, anonymous, and utterly banal.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a deviation. Someone //interfered//.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe scraping stops.\n\n\n\n\u201cDamnation. Are we looking at an XK?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe woman, thin blonde hair pulled back into a tight knot, clears her throat. \n\n\n\n\u201cThankfully, no, not yet. Forensics says we got lucky. Population density along the crash zone was just below minimum viability. Initial casualty projections-\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSorry to keep you all waiting.\u201d\n\n\n\nFaces turn. A man is in the doorway. There\u2019s soot on his clothes, and his footsteps leave the floor blackened. Not burnt- a careful distinction, that. \n\n\n\n\u201cOne. Good to see you.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe man takes his seat, brushing ash off of the shoulders of his overcoat, and the others orient towards him, turning in place. It is a round table, this quorum of the Overseers, but it has a head nonetheless.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are, at this moment, theoretically in violation of the Montreal Protocol[[footnote]]Treaty governing mutual aid and non-aggression between the SCP Foundation and the US Government in North America.[[/footnote]].\u201d\n\n\n\nThe woman in white lets her glasses drop from shaking fingers. \u201cPENTAGRAM has made overtures, then?\u201d\n\n\n\nOne shakes his head.\n\n\n\n\u201cNot yet. Notice I said //theoretically//. Although a failure to maintain Shoki is grounds for the nullification of the protections afforded to us under Montreal, that provision assumes that said failure would\u2019ve either resulted in an XK, or in the detonation of nuclear devices over major American population centers. To my knowledge, neither of those events have taken place.\u201d\n\n\n\nO5-6 frowns, golden fingers clenching rigidly.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a thin fucking line to rely on, One. Borders on //technicality//.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI disagree. As I understand it, the situation at the crash site is\u2026 uncertain, but practically amenable. Seven?\u201d\n\n\n\nHeads turn. The woman in white rubs at her temples, hair coming undone. \n\n\n\n\u201cPotentially- potentially yes. At this point, the hellgate should be self-sustaining, diminished but self-sustaining. There couldn\u2019t have been enough souls close enough to the crash site to have immediately allowed for first or second-order traversal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d\n\n\n\nShe almost smiles.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, last I checked, the sky isn\u2019t bleeding, so yes. Reasonably certain. At this point it\u2019s still possible for the aperture to be sealed, but it\u2019d take, god- it\u2019d take every mage we have in North America. Me included. The logistical considerations alone-\u201d\n\n\n\nGold fingers tap against glass, rhythm inscrutable. \n\n\n\n\u201c-and we\u2019d have to be guarded throughout the process. There\u2019s no telling how many lower-grade entities are coming through as we speak, and-\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be willing to authorize usage of the Helian Door.\u201d\n\n\n\nMurmurs rise from the monitors, overlapping atonal voices blending into staticky incomprehension. Seven stops mid-sentence, brushing strands of blonde hair out of her eyes.\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you, Six.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne steeples his fingers.\n\n\n\n\u201cReturning to the subject at hand, it seems to me that we are facing, at the moment, a containment breach. One of significant proportions, yes, but a simple containment breach nonetheless. Part of the status quo- a status quo //protected// under the Montreal Protocols. I believe that if we act quickly and decisively to resolve this crisis, PENTAGRAM will not pursue annulment.\u201d\n\n\n\n//\u201cYou cannot be certain.\u201d// \n\n\n\nImpossibly, the interjection cuts through SCUFFLE as a vitriolic hiss. Seven winces, clutching at her head, turning to stare daggers at the offending monitor.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cYou would trust PENTAGRAM to act in good faith?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI would trust PENTAGRAM to act //in its own self-interest//.\u201d\n\n\n\nSix laughs, golden fingers running through thinning hair.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou and I both know that\u2019s almost as bad, One.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI see no alternative. Would you have us resort to Ganymede while a hellgate escalates in plain daylight? Turtle up to weather against hypothetical retaliation when a very real threat to our mandate is right there to be dealt with?\u201d\n\n\n\nSix scowls. \u201cI do not like the shape of this. A pitfall at every turn. It stinks of //interference//.\u201d\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"president\"]]\n\n|>UNCLEAR PROBABILITIES DIVERGENT UNCLEAR\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nThe voice echoes from the walls, resonant. An eighth monitor rises soundlessly from the floor, black and featureless, a column of basalt. It serves no real purpose other than conversational courtesy. The thing it represents no longer has use for such frivolities as //perspective//. One turns to address it nonetheless, dipping his head politely.\n\n\n\n\u201cThree. Glad you could make it.\u201d\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"president\"]]\n\n|>TWENTY-THREE PERCENT OPERATIONAL CAPACITY PRESENT AND RECORDING\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nThe last man in the room twitches. Copper-corded limbs convulse and dead eyes shift subtly in a chalk-white face, pulled too taut over the skull. \n\n\n\n\u201cIt is the opinion of the Counterintelligence Directorate that there has been no significant compromise of deterrence systems concurrent to the present incident.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe factotum\u2019s voice is baritonal, deep and gravelly. Seven shifts in her seat uncomfortably.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"president\"]]\n\n|>AGREEMENT SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT CONCURRENCE\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you, gentlemen. That simplifies matters.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne leans forward in his seat.\n\n\n\n\u201cI clarify my proposal.

The commendation of all necessary non-garrisoned personnel and logistical assets for this purpose, until such time as containment has been established. Extraordinary Mobilization.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou are calling for the expenditure of our entire North American rapid response capability on a single anomaly.\u201d Six scoffs, incredulous. \n\n\n\n\u201cI am.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYou of all people should understand how //singularly vulnerable// of a position that\u2019d put us in.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne stands, beginning to pace the room. The monitors turn to follow his movements.\n\n\n\n\u201cI would remind this chamber that the Foundation\u2019s continued existence has always been dependent on remaining, in the eyes of the world, slightly more palatable than the alternative. Part of that is due to our deterrence doctrine, yes, but, I\u2019d like to think a larger part is due to the work that we do, the sacrifices that every person here has made and continues to make towards the cause. We are presented with an opportunity, gentlemen, to once again demonstrate our value- to persevere against the darkness that none other dare to touch.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s emphatic now, gesticulating, in his element. \n\n\n\nA monitor chimes in, corroborating.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt does seem particularly unlikely that PENTAGRAM would arrange for the creation of an active hellgate on American soil solely to fabricate casus belli to act against us. And even so, why //now//?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cMy point exactly.\u201d\n\n\n\nSix turns towards One.

Grid-squares are secured block by block, chthonic wails silenced by suppressed weaponry and muttered incantations. \n\n\n\nThe noose tightens.\n\n\n\nOn a whispered signal, the Helian Door hisses open in a plume of superheated gas. Walls of plasma bloom on the outskirts of Meeker, golden gates bright as the inside of the sun disgorging soldiers, vehicles, prefab watchtowers and concertainer. \n\n\n\nCast in the blood-light of the hellgate\u2019s shadow, they look almost like heroes.\n\n\n\nAbove them the sky bleeds and below them the earth distends with horror but they are the Foundation at war. Demons howl and hellfire rains from the scarlet sky in hissing droplets but they are the Foundation at war, and so their fire is steady and their maneuver is swift. \n\n\n\nWalls erupt from the blood-mist, knife edged, topped with concertina wire and spotlights. Hard-helmeted men with blue coveralls and determined expressions drive iron stakes into the flagellated earth as black-kevlar regiments hold the line with tactical sacrament and blessed gunfire mere feet away. There is none of the mechanized brutality of a Coalition fire mission, the esotericism of a Psychotronics intervention, the heedless overkill that is PENTAGRAM\u2019s penchant. \n\n\n\nThe perimeter forms, the perimeter holds, and the perimeter expands. \n\n\n\nThis is the Foundation at war.\n\n------\n\n++ ##red |2. UNDER THE GUN##\n\n------\n\nO5-7 ducks out of the helicopter, brushing thin blonde hair out of her eyes as the dry wind snags at her ponytail. The air stinks, petrochemical reek and gunpowder fumes mixing into an eye-watering miasma that has her retching, coughing into her fist, almost doubling over. Footsteps hurry towards her across the tamped dirt, and a black-gloved hand presses a respirator into her fingers. \n\n\n\nShe accepts it gratefully, clipping the mask on over her nose. \n\n\n\n\u201cSorry about the, ah, atmospheric situation, ma\u2019am. The techies say the skip\u2019s mucking with the airflow. Something about environmental resonance.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe trooper shuffles apologetically, gas-masked gaze scrupulously avoiding her face. There\u2019s a distinct unease to his stance, and his arm hovers awkwardly at his side, as if unsure whether or not to offer her a hand.\n\n\n\nShe gives him a reassuring smile, following him down the makeshift staging ground towards the first of the barricades. Periodically, chattering gunfire cuts through the scarlet smog, followed by echoing, resonant shrieks that linger uncomfortably in the black between her eyes. She grits her teeth, shaking her head irritably. \n\n\n\nThe command tent is a buzzing hive of fluttering white coats and blue coveralls punctuated by the shrill screams of power tools and the bassy thrum of thaumoelectric generators. Two guards flank the entrance flap, snapping to attention as she approaches. She takes a moment to shrug off her heavy greatcoat, nodding gratefully as the trooper considerately moves to receive the mass of warded fabric. Stretching her shoulders, she reaches for nonspace with a twist of will, pulling against the air. Laminated white polyester slides into her hand from the gap between atoms.\n\n\n\nSlipping on her labcoat, O5-7 steps into the command post.\n\n\n\n\u201cOVERSEER ON DECK!\u201d\n\n\n\nThe shout ripples through the room. A hundred pairs of feet stand at attention, a ring of stoic faces following her every move, encircling her like sunflowers facing the sun. Bile rises in her throat, but Seven bites it back down. She gives them what she hopes is a winning smile.\n\n\n\n\u201cCould I have a word with Commander Jefferson? Everyone else, back to your stations.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe room mutedly resumes movement, voices hushed, a hundred pairs of ears straining to grasp at the edict of a demigod, the command of an Overseer. Even the power tools sound sullen, whirring anxiously. \n\n\n\n\u201cThat would be me, ma\u2019am.\u201d A voice calls from the back of the room, deep and baritonal. \n\n\n\nSeven turns to take his measure. Dark brown eyes set in an alert, clean-shaven face, marred by an impressive scar distorting the corner of his mouth into an exaggerated, downturned scowl. Nondescript Foundation BDUs, ironed crisp, polished boots and a holstered pistol at his hip. She knows the type. She's seen a thousand of him in her tenure, across a dozen different sites and half a hundred task forces. \n\n\n\nSometimes, she wondered if the Foundation really was cloning people. \n\n\n\nOne had never quite given her a straight answer when she\u2019d asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow is the situation on the ground?\u201d\n\n\n\nJefferson\u2019s face sours.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo be frank? Not great.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a sustained burst of gunfire, followed by a succession of concussive blasts that rattle the tent, as if to punctuate his point. More ephemeral screaming. Seven tries to keep the wince off of her face.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve secured the perimeter, constructed defenses, gotten basic operational infrastructure up and running. The boys from Nu-7 are working on bringing the nuclear contingency online.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe hesitates, shoulders slumping slightly.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to encounter insurmountable logistical issues. They\u2019re coming from the gate at a rate that\u2019s eventually going to outpace our ammunition supply. I\u2019ve had the suppression teams working in shifts since day one, but everyone\u2019s on edge. It feels like we\u2019re going to be overrun.\u201d\n\n\n\nJefferson meets her gaze fully for the first time. \n\n\n\n\u201cTo be honest, ma\u2019am, I think the men are expecting you to pull a rabbit out of a hat.\u201d \n\n\n\nAfter a beat, he blanches, quickly looking down. \u201cN-no offense.\u201d Seven notices sudden perspiration gleaming on his forehead and sighs internally.\n\n\n\n\u201cNone taken.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe entrance flap rustles. A balding, potbellied man in a disheveled black rubber apron bursts through, scanning the tent apprehensively. Jefferson waves him over. \n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019d be Doctor Jameson from Beta-77. To my understanding, he and his team have been waiting for you.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cThank you, Commander. That\u2019ll be all.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe salutes her again, snapping his heels together.\n\n\n\nSeven turns to go, then hesitates. Facing the room, she raises her voice, trying her best to sound authoritative, calm, to project control the way One does so effortlessly. \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been told that some of you here have been expecting a miracle. The good news is, that is my department. Carry on.\u201d\n\n\n\nHer voice sounds wavering, even to her, but the room gives an appreciative cheer nonetheless. Swallowing nausea, Seven follows the doctor out of the tent. \n\n\n\nThere is work to be done.\n\n------\n\nA demon\u2019s severed head drips orange ichor onto the blue tarping of the lab bench. It\u2019s vaguely selachian, mottled gray skin streaked with phosphorescent blue stripes. Two jagged arcs of obsidian curve from its forehead like antlers, glistening wetly. As Seven watches, serpentine pupils dilate in lidless sockets, swiveling up to look at her. The thing\u2019s mouth twitches.\n\n\n\nSeven slides another silver needle into its skull.\n\n\n\nJameson stands next to her, bearded face furrowed. Sweat pours off of his bald scalp and runs down his face in perspicuous droplets. Occasionally, he mops at his face with a yellow handkerchief, though it barely seems to help. Seven doesn\u2019t mind. At least he hasn\u2019t tried to salute her yet.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re uh, pretty sure that the instances coming through the gate are, for all intents and purposes, fully substantiated. If you would let go of the probe, ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\n\n\nSeven nods, stepping back from the desk. Jameson taps rapidly on the keyboard cradled to his chest, then hits enter. \n\n\n\nThe lights of the mobile laboratory flicker, the background hum of ventilation fans sputtering to a halt. The demon\u2019s head twitches, eyes rolling back as each of the seven silver spikes buried in its skull flare a brilliant, blinding blue. There is a smell like rotting eggs and abscesses. Seven turns away, sleeve pulled over her mouth. \n\n\n\n\u201cIf that thing had been a normal manifestation, it would've been disintegrated by the disvocation matrix we just pumped into it.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe head is still there, faintly steaming, clotted orange ichor leaking slowly from each eye. It no longer twitches. Jameson\u2019s mouth curls with distaste, and he moves to dislodge the silver spikes, sliding each out of the demon\u2019s flesh with a wet squelch. \n\n\n\nSeven nods, comprehending. \n\n\n\n\u201cInstead of being matter from our reality held together by will from the outside, the demon has crossed over fully, body and bowel. The hellgate isn\u2019t just manifesting them. It\u2019s translating them into our dimension.\u201d\n\n\n\nJameson slides the head into a biowaste crate and sighs, sealing the lid.\n\n\n\n\u201cPrecisely, ma'am. I'm sure you see where the problem is.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just seal off the breach. They\u2019d just force their way through, regardless of the warding schema. We actually have to close it altogether.\u201d \n\n\n\nSeven peels off ichor-slick gloves, rubbing her hands together, beginning to pace the room.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want this laboratory to myself for the next twelve hours. Access to every scrap of data you\u2019ve collected about the hellgate, about Meeker, local geological and thaumaturgic readings. A thaumoelectric generator. As much coffee as can reasonably be had. And a whiteboard.\u201d\n\n\n\nJameson looks up from wiping down the bench, face pale. Seven realizes a slow grin has spread across her face. She lets it sit there until Jameson looks away.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am, uh, O5-7 ma\u2019am, of-of course. Right away.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOne more thing, Jameson.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cBring me more of their ###B200ED| heads##.\u201d\n\n------\n\n##red| The little things are running.##\n\n\n\nAsveth Korgaul, twenty-eighth to taste the true blood of the Tree, nineteenth of the Mighty, ##red| he-who-is-favored-in-murder## lifts a head the size of minor moons and sniffs at the bloodsoaked air of Upper Megiddo.

Golden fingers fiddle with the plastic safety cap of the Armageddon Button, flicking it up, then down, up, then down. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not actually a button, of course, more of a switch, really, and truth be told not particularly apocalyptic compared to some of the other ones at his immediate disposal. He sits nestled at the center of Site-01, enshrined in the shining, sterile, utterly secure heart of the Foundation. He is the only living, breathing thing within\u00a0\u00a0\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00a0\u00a0kilometers. He is, practically speaking, the loneliest man alive. \n\n\n\nSeven left by apportation thirty minutes after the meeting ended. One had kept him company for a little while longer, gossiping of this and that matter of state, before cheerfully stepping into the fireplace and turning to ash. Off to his bunker in the Mojave no doubt, off to beat gods at dice and host devils for dinner and delegate everything actually important to everyone else. \n\n\n\nWiping at his mouth, Six reaches for the nearest keyboard.\n\n\n\n[[div class =\"elaimal\"]]\n\nINITIALIZING O5COM_v14.3 SECURE TELECOM INTERFACE\n\nINSTANCE 3455 LOGGED\n\nWELCOME, O5-6\n\n\n\nO5-6: Just received hourlies from Meeker.

Old springs, long gone stiff, dig sharply into his back. He winces. \n\n\n\nThe damned things were relics, dredged up from the dying days of the Cold War. Their arthritic engines had practically given the pit crew a nervous conniption upon inspection, and traversing the turret for any length of time filled the basket with the agonized screeching of neglected servos. There was a reason Hammer Down hadn\u2019t deployed in force since the eighties: the arsenal beneath Ruby Mountain was practically a boneyard, half of it stolen from other boneyards. \n\n\n\nAt least the bushmasters still worked.\n\n\n\nThe backline clamors with activity, vast auto-censers vaporizing industrial quantities of frankincense and myrrh over a pyramid of piled ammunition crates as black flocks of conscripted vestry recite tactical sacrament with a fervor comprehensible only to the damned. Gun crews scramble up and down the palisades, skidding into foxholes, rapping atop sigil-touched turrets rotating as one to face the very mouth of Hell, white-hot on their thermals.\n\n\n\nMorris counters up and down the line simultaneously crescendo into ear-splitting screeches that rise into frequencies inaudible, before shorting out altogether in sparking bursts of static.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nFreedman looks towards the burning horizon, swallows his Zyn, and pre-sights the main gun.\n\n\n\nThe last belts are loaded, the last hatches are sealed, the last pieces of chewing tobacco spat ignominiously into the rusty earth. \n\n\n\nThere is a terrible, breathless, aching silence. \n\n\n\nThe earth shifts, boils, shatters. \n\n\n\n\u201cWeapons free.\u201d\n\n\n\nHell follows.\n\n------\n\nAsveth Korgaul is close now, so terribly, achingly close.

He sheds his adamantite scales for ones of mere graphene, his supernova claws for ones of base enchantment. He sheds his black crown and places it reverently on the ground, where it immediately begins melting its way down into the crust of Upper Megiddo. \n\n\n\nNaked, supplicant, purified, he ascends towards the undersky upon winds of slaughter. \n\n\n\nHis pilgrimage awaits. \n\n\n\n##red| tamarin tesh asham korgath turnal tamarin tesh avashin tomath vaten ela ela ela tamarin tesh##\n\n\n\nBefore him, the ##red| lesser## flee, maddened with terror, and behind him they flock in untold billions.

His face feels sticky and warm and blood runs down the plastic screen of the FCS display in front of him in black rivulets. Offhandedly, he feels a moment of sympathy for the cleanup crew.\n\n\n\nGolden claws gleam through the gash in the hull, widening the gap in a screech of tortured metal. He coughs again, wetly. Something in his chest pops and deflates. \n\n\n\nA figure stares down at him from the breach, black on red, bipedal, covered with a dense carpet of wriggling tendrils like the underbelly of a millipede. Six insectoid arms grip the edges of the cut, pulling. The side of the Bradley falls away into ribbons of twisted steel. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s grinning at him.\n\n\n\nHe grins back.\n\n\n\nBlood-slick fingers reach for the detcord of the claymore mine strapped across his chest, pulling the pin.\n\n------\n\nFifteen minutes into the battle sees Commander Lionel Jefferson realize that all is lost. \n\n\n\nThe command tent rattles with the blast of the handful of ancient Paladins that consist of the sum total of the Foundation\u2019s artillery corps. Privately, he doubts that even ten times their number would\u2019ve been enough to make a difference.\n\n\n\nIf he survived, Jefferson resolves, clenching his teeth, he\u2019d have the Logistics Division lined up against the wall and shot. He\u2019d do it himself if he had to.\n\n\n\nThere had simply been too many of them. Sheer volume of bodies had nearly instantaneously overwhelmed the output of the first killzones, a red wave pouring over concertina wire and trenches to slam liquidly against the first set of palisades. Almost half of the Bradleys had been lost in those frantic first minutes, dug-in outside the walls. There simply had been nowhere to retreat them to, not after the primary fallback routes had become entirely inundated by swarms of blue-feathered, multi-headed pangolins that spit acid, ate metal and ran at highway speeds. He\u2019d ordered them abandoned instead, scuttled with blessed thermite and satchel charges, and personally watched from atop the concertainer as the bonfires flared up one by one, each briefly illuminating the scuttling, crawling stream of bodies before snuffing out.\n\n\n\nNot a single crewman had belayed the order. \n\n\n\nNot a single one had made it back behind the walls.\n\n\n\nThe emplacement itself would hold for a while longer, at least. He\u2019d ordered the M113s, alongside the remaining Bradleys, up onto dirt ramps, depressing their Vulcans over the palisade to fire point-blank into the horde as they scrabbled and scratched at the base of the walls. Jefferson was confident that they\u2019d manage to keep the demons at bay for as long as the ammo held out. \n\n\n\nBy his most generous estimates, they\u2019d last for another half-hour. \n\n\n\nStaring through the blood-mist at his crumbling frontline, Commander Lionel Jefferson comes to the terrible realization that the Montana National Guard genuinely might\u2019ve done better in his position. For the first time in twenty years of honorable service, despair sets in. \n\n\n\nThere was only so much you could do with a scalpel, however sharp, when arrayed against an exploding volcano.\n\n\n\n\u201cPriority one is making sure the Overseer makes it out alive. Send five men from my alpha company to the lab. Make sure she\u2019s on the first truck out of here. Start evacuating the backline staff to the minimum viable fallback distance alongside the remaining garrison force. Send anyone left to the front.

Her thin blonde hair is unwound, falling around her shoulders in scraggly streams, and she\u2019s smiling. \n\n\n\nThere\u2019s nothing nervous about it this time, no hint of uncertainty or doubt. It\u2019s a smile that casts a shadow, balanced on the knife\u2019s edge of wild, unconscious charisma and cackling madness. It\u2019s a smile that cuts like a tungsten rod dropped from orbit.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s the smile of one about to do the impossible.\n\n\n\nAgainst all experience, all rational belief, all smatterings of common sense, Jefferson feels his heart beating with wild hope. His arm is raised in salute. He doesn\u2019t even remember doing it. The tent is quiet. The battle is quiet. Hell itself seems to have gone quiet. \n\n\n\nThe Overseer\u2019s command rings out like the edict of a demigod. \n\n\n\n\u201cI need to borrow your nuclear bomb.\u201d\n\n------\n\n++ ##red |4.

The ranks of Hell still, turning as one to face the burning pit, kneeling in the dust. The defenders left atop the wall rally, cutting them down in their unmoving hundreds. This is no matter. \n\n\n\n##red| Asveth Korgaul is come.##\n\n\n\nFrom the hellgate a black arm erupts, ten stories high, trailing gouts of baleful flame. The blood-mist thickens, congeals, dripping into respirators, choking, sickening, rancid. \n\n\n\nThere is a terrible, triumphant, trumpeting howl, and it is thus.\n\n\n\n##red| tamarin tesh asham korgath turnal tamarin tesh avashin tomath vaten ela ela ela tamarin tesh##\n\n\u00a0\n\n##red| shomaush shomaush, shomaush teshet raketh##\n\n\n\n##red| <oh red lord, oh red lord, oh victorious red lord>##\n\n\n\nThe contest is met. \n\n**~**\n\n//An old man and a young girl stare side-by-side at a shaky chalk diagram// //drawn onto the concrete floor of a cell.

The earth roils and fractures. Sections of the barricade are brought to ruin, its defenders dismayed, dismounting their vehicles and running for shelter, knowing themselves as ants in a titanomachy. High above, in the upper atmosphere, the air crackles and snaps with thaumoelectric discharge. The wind comes, dry and hot, smelling of ozone and blood. Some of the white-coats drop to their knees, crumpling to the ground like paper dolls. The rest continue the incantation, blinking sweat from bloodshot eyes. They cannot stop now.\n\n\n\nThe seventh reveals her hand at last. \n\n\n\n###B200ED| Martyr\u2019s blood,##\n\n###B200ED| King\u2019s blood,##\n\n###B200ED| Stolen dawn,##\n\n###B200ED| Law of flame,##\n\n###B200ED| Glint on glass,##\n\n\n\n++* ###ff7700| SUNRISE##\n\n\n\nAt the center of the circle the alpha warhead detonates in a plume of searing light. \n\n\n\n###B200ED| The seventh has bought her miracle with the blood of the sun.## \n\n\n\nShe should be blind, seared and skinless. She should be ash, less than ash, molecular debris floating on radioactive wind. She clenches her fist and the nuclear plume rears into the air, bound ineffably by the circle into a spear of light a mile high. The white-coats are weeping tears of blood, broken lips still moving in recitation of the incantation seared into their skulls by atomic flame. \n\n\n\nThe seventh breathes in, breathes out, brings her fist to her chest with a final shout. The miracle flows into her like the breath of God.\n\n\n\nFor a moment, for an eternity, she is astride the world.\n\n\n\nShe spares the hellgate a single, smoldering glance, and ###B200ED| calls down the sun.##\n\n------\n\nO5-6 lets the glass slip from his fingers, shattering thousand-dollar liquor over billion-dollar floors. \n\n\n\n\u201cHoly fucking shit.\u201d\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"omalley\"]]\n\n\u201cMister President, fifteen minutes ago, the Foundation detonated a nuclear device on American soil.\u201d\n\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\nAsveth Korgaul feels the ##red| tear## slam shut on his arm, sundering it in a great gout of ichor.\n\n\n\nHe is falling, falling, falling back onto the black plain of the abyss. \n\n\n\nHis body crashes back into Upper Megiddo with the force of celestial impact.

The rest of Beta-77 follows shortly after, slumping into the dust. Dimly, she\u2019s aware of medical teams rushing the field, someone shouting orders.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m okay\u201d, she manages, through bruised and bleeding lips. \u201cI\u2019m okay. See to the others first.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s raining over Meeker. The blood-mist washes away, extinguishing the lingering flames. Wounded are recovered, the dead gathered where they lie. What\u2019s left of them, anyway. Those that can be identified are body-bagged. Graves are dug for those that can\u2019t.\n\n\n\nIn the downpour, the second half of the mission begins.\n\n\n\nContainment.\n\n\n\nHard-helmeted men with determined expressions and blue coveralls move into the town first, carefully navigating the glassy ruins left by atomic miracle. What concertainer segments remain intact are recovered, the rest reduced to rubble by acetylene torches and demolition charges. Concertina wire is respooled, foxholes and earthworks concealed and flattened by a small squadron of bulldozers. \n\n\n\nIn the end, the hellgate itself proves almost a mercy. Burnt out Bradleys and brass casings are collected, then piled en masse into the gaping maw. The first shovelful of dirt falls into the pit accompanied by rousing cheers. It\u2019s bitter work, but spirits are high. \n\n\n\nAfter all, they\u2019ve just saved the world.\n\n\n\nFoundation webcrawlers scour the internet, corrupting data, erasing files, deleting photos. Dusty departmental archives are raided, certain files defaced. A careful story is floated to select media outlets. Municipal, state, and federal officials disjointly receive word of some kind of disaster, a fire, maybe, or an earthquake. The reports are unclear and contradictory. What they are unanimous on, however, is that help is already on-site. \n\n\n\n[[div class=\"dictation\"]]\n\nThe situation is under control.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nA select few families receive knocks on the door in the middle of the night by faceless men in plain suits and dark glasses with official-looking badges.

Past the escalating warning signs, past the soft perimeter of artfully concealed pressure plates and infrared cams, past the hard perimeter of retracted gun emplacements and the JSOC counter-assault team watching him through thousand-dollar thermals, past the steel gate that slides open, smooth and silent.\n\n\n\nHe parks just off the road, takes the stack of boxes, still warm, out of the trunk, and heads down. \n\n\n\nDown, into the unassuming unmarked concrete access tunnel.\n\n\n\nDown, past the recessed blast doors, past the bedrock, past the geomantic wards layered thick enough to bite. \n\n\n\nDown, until his breath catches in his throat, short and sharp, misting the air.\n\n\n\nDown, until space wraps around itself like a garrote wire, down into hypothetical N-space, down into everything that Langley ever was and everything Langley will ever be.\n\n\n\nWelcome to PENTAGRAM.

Much of the work of the day was spent mounting and securing the remaining Bradleys atop a series of flatbed haulers departing for the railroad junction at Glenwood Spring under the guise of an Army field exercise, and neither will they be the last. There is a garrison left behind, token perimeter security and a squad of glum-faced researchers who, having drawn short straws, will stay on-site for another three months, monitoring spacetime integrity and any lingering tartarean contamination. Seven attempts a pep talk, reciting the platitudes One bade her memorize by rote. The words feel plastic, artificial, but she sees their backs straighten nonetheless. She walks away before they can attempt a salute.\n\n\n\nSeven stretches out in the mercifully empty backseat of the Humvee, letting out a shuddering breath. Thaumic exhaustion roils beneath her skin, flaring into painful spasms that leave her wincing, rubbing at her arms.\u00a0\u00a0She wonders at the lengths Jefferson must have gone to reserve an entire vehicle for her personal use, stifling a guilty smirk as she pictures a squad of grim-faced operators sitting stoically in each other\u2019s laps. \n\n\n\nHer eyes slip shut, just for a moment.\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"omalley\"]]\n\nCigarette smoke curls dimly in the blue light, spun into a slow vortex by the ceiling fan.

His eardrums pop, warm blood trickling down the side of his head, just in time to defend against the truly virulent stream of verbal cognitohazards erupting from the corpse-puppet as it lunges at him, pale hands outstretched.\n\n\n\nThe impact knocks him to the floor, air rushing from his lungs as the thing wraps icy, implacable fingers around his neck and squeezes. The dead eyes staring back into his own glint with malign consciousness. The factotum doesn\u2019t smile, not with its jaw dangling loosely by copper wire, but there\u2019s an impression of one nonetheless.\n\n\n\nHe claws uselessly at dead flesh, golden fingers scraping bloodless rivulets into its cheeks.

There is a spray of sparks as the disintegration hits something critical. The thing\u2019s grip slackens. \n\n\n\nSix slides the inert factotum off of him, scrabbling on hands and knees towards the central console. Blood fills his mouth, vision gone spotty with distortion.

It\u2019s always cold in Site-19, doubly so in the surface wards. Drinks would ice over if you left them out overnight, cans of coke would burst, and the water came out of the faucets cold enough to burn when it flowed at all. He\u2019d wear gloves, he ought to wear gloves, half the infirmary was full from frostbite this time of year, but the damned things made keyboards impossible to use. \n\n\n\nHe picks up his mug of steaming coffee, wrapping his fingers around it gratefully before taking a small, measured sip. He has to make it last. A refill would mean making the ten minute trek back across the outer perimeter into the barracks, through the driving wind that cut through layers like a knife, that blew gritty snow into your eyes and up your nose, through the cold that left your lips bleeding and chapped.\n\n\n\nThere is a flashing red light on the display. Mason sets the cup down, peering cautiously at his monitor. Something is at the vehicle gate.\n\n\n\nTourists, probably. There were always tourists here, coming up and down the highways across the tundra and they always, always managed to get lost. He accesses the gate camera, wincing as newly warmed fingers clatter against icy keys. Gray screen.\n\n\n\nThe bastards on second shift forgot to defrost the lenses, again. \n\n\n\nShouldering his rifle, Mason presses the yellow caution, just in case, bracing himself before opening the door to the guard booth.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey!

The mode through which this instance was produced is unknown as the entity was currently not being observed, and was only noticed during routine inspection for containment purposes hours later. The new SCP-1213-1 instance was removed from the containment vessel at once and placed in the care of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for study.</p>\n<p>As is typical for Foundation sites during times of increased holiday energy, it is believed that this event is an example of immaculate conception, as SCP-1213 has not had access to other members of its original dimension in several years. However, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has suggested that this event may be completely natural, pointing out the lack of consensus on SCP-1213's reproductive biology. Further work is required before a full determination is made. However, the following addition to SCP-1213\u2019s file is requested in the meantime:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Description of SCP-1213-1:</strong> The recently observed SCP-1213-1 instance is a wooden and rubber catapult of similar design to the larger SCP-1213, although much smaller. Of note, the design of the SCP-1213 instance uses rubber bands as a launching mechanism in place of the steel fittings on SCP-1213, taking an appropriate form for its small size. As a result, the SCP-1213-1 instance has been placed into the care of Sector-25 researchers in order to conduct a longitudinal growth study of the entity to determine more about the biology of the SCP-1213 organism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"footer-box\">\n<div class=\"bottom-left-box\">\n<div class=\"name-box\">Dr. Donatello \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</div>\n<div class=\"title-box\">Foundation Researcher (Sector-25)</div>\n<div class=\"sign-off-box\">Secure, Contain, Protect</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"attachment-box\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">*Open\u00a0email\u00a0attachment*</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Close</a></div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"dyna-email-container\">\n<div class=\"dyna-email\">\n<div class=\"header-box\">\n<div class=\"top-left-box cc-rchan7@scp.int\">\n<div class=\"from-box\">From:</div>\n<div class=\"to-box\">To:</div>\n<div class=\"cc-box cc-rchan7@scp.int\">CC:</div>\n<div class=\"subject-box\">Subject:</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"top-middle-box cc-rchan7@scp.int\">\n<div class=\"from-name-box\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">sector25_director@scp.int</span></div>\n<div class=\"to-name-box\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">dtjredacted@scp.int</span></div>\n<div class=\"cc-text-box cc-rchan7@scp.int\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">rchan7@scp.int</span></div>\n<div class=\"subject-text-box\">Re: Request of Addenda to be added to the SCP-1213 File</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"content-box\">\n<hr/>\n<p>Sounds good.

The mode through which this instance was produced is unknown as the entity was currently not being observed, and was only noticed during routine inspection for containment purposes hours later. The new SCP-1213-1 instance was removed from the containment vessel at once and placed in the care of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for study. \n\n\n\nAs is typical for Foundation sites during times of increased holiday energy, it is believed that this event is an example of immaculate conception, as SCP-1213 has not had access to other members of its original dimension in several years. However, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has suggested that this event may be completely natural, pointing out the lack of consensus on SCP-1213's reproductive biology. Further work is required before a full determination is made. However, the following addition to SCP-1213\u2019s file is requested in the meantime:\n\n\n\n> **Description of SCP-1213-1:** The recently observed SCP-1213-1 instance is a wooden and rubber catapult of similar design to the larger SCP-1213, although much smaller. Of note, the design of the SCP-1213 instance uses rubber bands as a launching mechanism in place of the steel fittings on SCP-1213, taking an appropriate form for its small size. As a result, the SCP-1213-1 instance has been placed into the care of Sector-25 researchers in order to conduct a longitudinal growth study of the entity to determine more about the biology of the SCP-1213 organism.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:dynamic-emails\">:scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails</a> attachment-end=--\n\n|name= Dr. Donatello \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n|title= Foundation Researcher (Sector-25)\n\n|signoff= Secure, Contain, Protect\n\n|signoff-icon= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:dynamic-emails/Default_Profile_Icon.png\n\n|attachment= http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/launched-into-parenthood/SCP-1213-1.jpeg\n\n]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:dynamic-emails\">:scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails</a> start=--\n\n|from= sector25_director@scp.int\n\n|to= dtjredacted@scp.int\n\n|cc= rchan7@scp.int\n\n|subject= Re: Request of Addenda to be added to the SCP-1213 File\n\n\n\n]]\n\nSounds good.

Between work, work and\u2026 <em>work</em>, he didn\u2019t have much time left in the week. How much of that was true and how much of it was a bad excuse in order to nor confront reality, he didn\u2019t even know, but it didn\u2019t really matter, because ever since he came back from Afghanistan, every year on the exact same day, Ibarra took the time to visit his friends.</p>\n<img alt=\"lazos1.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/lazos/lazos1.jpg\"/>\n<p>The agent stared at the piece of stone in front of him with an expression that was difficult to read. This was the last one he was going to visit this morning. The one he saved for last every year. He kneeled in front of it, noticing a bouquet of flowers he hadn\u2019t left. He faintly smiled at that.</p>\n<p>\"I see they are still visiting you, huh?\" He talked to the tomb. He paused, the subtle whistle of the light morning breeze being the only sound in the place. It was overwhelming.</p>\n<p>\"Your little sister must be all grown\u2026 How old is she turning this year? Seventeen? Eighteen? Mich told me she was thinking of studying photography.\" His voice began to fade alongside his smile.</p>\n<p>\"You\u2019d be\u2026 proud of her.\" The expression of the agent turned hollow and distant. He observed the tombstone in silence, clenching his teeth and frowning.</p>\n<p>Every year was the same. He avoided the topic, he tried to face it on November 11th, he talked to some pieces of stone, and he left more hollow than he arrived. It infuriated him. With a growl and a scowl, the man balled his fist with force and hit the grass, looking away from the tombstone. He was mad. At the circumstances, at the world, at God, even. But, above all, at himself. Because of him, the mothers of his friends were left without sons. Because of him, his friend wouldn\u2019t see his sister grow. Because of him, there were less good men in the world. Simple, <em>he didn\u2019t do enough.</em></p>\n<p>Fragments of the incident were repeated in his mind over and over again like a movie, always thinking how he could have done things differently. He changed what happened in his memory, took a different step, took a different path. But even in every scenario he made up, he couldn\u2019t escape the blood, nor the screams.</p>\n<p>His head started to feel heavy and unstable, leaving him dizzy.</p>\n<p>Ibarra closed his eyes, trying to focus. It didn\u2019t matter. He didn\u2019t do things differently, and that was it. Now he had to deal with the consequences, even if he didn\u2019t know how to.</p>\n<p>His hands and lips trembled, his breathing started to accelerate.</p>\n<p>When he returned from Afghanistan and got offered a job at the Foundation he didn\u2019t think twice, he needed some kind of redemption for his acts, and the job description fit the bill. But above all, he needed to <em>get away.</em> His position as an agent and emergency doctor forced him to move constantly. He would never have permanent housing, and he never had a fixed team. His work was getting showing up, helping, and then disengaging completely, then repeat the next week. And that worked for him. No time to form bonds meant he didn\u2019t have to add names to the list of visitors. He would never again be responsible for\u2026</p>\n<p>Ibarra started to feel every beat of his heart thump in his ears. He felt his throat closing, at the same time that his erratic and irregular heartbeats caused him a strong and sudden sensation of nausea.</p>\n<p>The agent raised his head slightly, reading the epitaph on the tombstone.</p>\n<p><em>The risk of losing whom you love is a small price to pay to have the opportunity to help them.</em></p>\n<p>The knot in his throat and chest tightened, and he felt like the world was about to crush him with invisible walls.</p>\n<p>\u201cFigured I\u2019d find you here.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The agent standing in front of the tomb turned his face around suddenly, the unexpected voice snapped him out of his thoughts and his mental turmoil. Swallowing his emotions, he placed his narrow sunglasses to hide the storm that was about to unfold. The owner of the voice was a tattooed man with long hair tied in a messy ponytail, a bit taller than Ibarra and with an Argentinian accent.</p>\n<p>Ibarra offered a light smile as a greeting.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Steffano.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steffano approached ibarra with a calm gesture, stopping at his side and in front of the tombstone. An elegant, grey formal vest overlayed with a black shirt matched a black pair of trousers, accompanied vy a pair of shoes that oscillated between a sporty and formal look. The agent's sleeves were rolled up, leaving a contrast between the formal and the aggressiveness that his tattoos implicitly radiated.</p>\n<p>In between his hands he brought a pair of folders, light in color, coated in plastic.</p>\n<p>\"Am I interrupting?\" Steffano asked with caution \"Finding you outside working hours was more difficult than I expected.\u201d</p>\n<p>The dark-skinned man sighed, observing with certain regret the tombstone in front of him, trying to clear the thoughts that made noise inside of his head. Eventually, he shook his head and stood up</p>\n<p>\"Nah, I was just finishing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steffano stood still in silence for a second alongside Ibarra. He never knew the soldier in the tombstone, but he knew they were someone important to his friend, so the least he could do was show some empathy and respect. He looked Ibarra out of the corner of his eye, noticing the clear tension in his hands and shoulders, speaking:</p>\n<p>\"You can\u2019t keep blaming yourself for this kind of stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ibarra smiled slightly, his gaze fixed on the tombstone.</p>\n<p>\"I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you keep doing so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ibarra took a moment to reply.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>Because I could\u2019ve done more. Because I should\u2019ve done more. Because I couldn\u2019t help them. Because I had to help them. Because they had a family. Because they didn\u2019t deserve to die. Because they should\u2019ve been saved. Because I should\u2019ve died with them.</em></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steffano pursed his lips lightly and nodded in an understanding gesture to his friend, giving him a firm pat on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, I get you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ibarra directed his gaze towards his teammate, feeling for just a brief second how the walls that tightened against him eased a bit. He knew that he understood, and that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t ask more at the moment.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Pero bueno,</em> are you visiting anyone, Steffano?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steffano let out a slight chuckle, shaking his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, mine aren\u2019t here. I was looking for you, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ibarra arched a brow, intrigued. He pointed to the folders that Steffano carried with a nod.</p>\n<p>\"Does it have anything to do with the folders you have there? Don\u2019t tell me you came here to give me paperwork.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steffano smirked, extending the folder towards Ibarra so he would take it.</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ibarra adjusted his glasses and took the folders, opening them. They contained a multitude of documents: budget estimates, agent's profiles, authorization letters, among other files. The documentation looked a lot like what's needed to authorize a new unit. The dark-skinned man looked at his friend over his glasses, waiting for him to tell him more while he reviewed in detail the information.</p>\n<p>\"I\u2019m building a team. I want my <em>own</em> squadron to play by my <em>own</em> rules, I feel that part of being stuck on the other side of the veil means cutting off your legs, if that makes any sense. I\u2019ve decided that if I\u2019m going to work for these people and their purposes, might as well do it in the way I deem correct. We are going to trip over and over again as we manage to reach something similar to stability, but until then I want my people near me. People I believe are worth having around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ibarra looked at his friend with certain doubt.</p>\n<p>\"You don\u2019t sound too sure of all of this. You usually are more painstaking, Steffano. This is the first time since we\u2019ve met that you try to make something in a hasty manner, I don\u2019t really know how to react.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Maybe, the only thing I can admit is that you\u2019re right, it\u2019s something new. Neither you, nor me are used to work other way that isn\u2019t a fucking chain of command formed by a pretentious general that has been in power behind a desk for 40 years, without getting a single damned scratch. And you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ibarra laughed with certain bitterness towards Steffano\u2019s comment, nodding. \"I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d His expression changed when his gaze stopped for a second in the profile of an agent that caught his attention.</p>\n<p>\"This boy\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\"Is this the one you\u2019ve been training personally?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steffano smirked when he saw who Ibarra was pointing at.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. V\u00edctor Penz,\u201d Steffano sighed. \"The kid is quite the case, but he has potential. <em>A lot</em> of potential.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"It\u2019s\u2026 Just a kid.\u201d There was a certain worry in the agent\u2019s tone. \u201cThere must be something in him for you to even consider having him around. He looks like a rookie, a problematic brat without any valid records.\u201d Ibarra searched between V\u00edctor\u2019s file over and over again, as if he was trying to gather some secret information in between the papers.</p>\n<p>\"He has it. Trust me. In fact, I was thinking of assigning him to an operation soon. I\u2019m not sure what kind of operation, but I\u2019d like for him to grow used to the kind of shit one can see in this weird world. The creatures and all that shit. And when that happens, you\u2019ll be there to see it, sooner or later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"My God, Steffano,\u201d The agent was conflicted by the idea. \u201cI don't know if it's a very good idea or if age and field work are driving you crazy, and it seems that you want to drive the kid crazy on the way too by throwing him head-first into these things. You not working for national intelligence agencies anymore doesn\u2019t mean you can throw away all cover and risk your personal reputation for a crazy midnight idea. I mean\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>The tattooed man interrupted him.</p>\n<p>\"Do you trust me?\u201d Steffano looked directly into Ibarra\u2019s eyes, trying to look further from his gaze.</p>\n<p>Ibarra blinked a few times, bewildered because of the question.</p>\n<p>\"What?\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Do you trust me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\"I\u2026\u201d Ibarra meditated for a few seconds. \u201cYeah, of course I trust you, dude. You\u2019re only old and crazy, but I\u2019ll be there when you get shot by a few dudes with no arms nor face.\u201d Ibarra began laughing resignedly.</p>\n<p>\"Fantastic. That\u2019s all I needed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steffano gave Ibarra a moment for him to finish looking at the documentation and processing the information.</p>\n<p>\"Your support in this would mean a lot, old man. I need people who are committed, capable, and whom I can trust. You are all three of those.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Ibarra sighed deeply. It wasn\u2019t a bad idea. A unit like this could be of great help for the Foundation. Most importantly, it could be of great help for <em>people</em>. A large number of losses, both civilian and from personnel in operations were due to a lack of rapid response in emergency situations. A large number of losses were due to <em>a lack of support.</em></p>\n<p>But joining a unit like that would signify stability. He would no longer be sent only to isolated jobs where his role was to appear and then bid farewell. He would go back to having some type of squadron, Ibarra would have to coexist with the same people constantly. He would have to <em>take care</em> of the same people constantly. Inevitably, he would form <em>bonds</em> with those people, because he was like that, he couldn\u2019t disconnect. And given the nature of the work, those people would be at risk of dying <em>constantly.</em></p>\n<p>The agent took his eyes off the documentation that was in his hands, redirecting his sight towards the tombstone that was forgotten in the conversation until this moment. He looked at it for a few seconds, ones that felt like minutes to him. He read the name. <em>Douglas Daniels.</em></p>\n<p><em>The risk of losing whom you love is a small price to pay to have the opportunity to help them.</em></p>\n<p>Ibarra spoke in a serious tone, without taking his eyes off the phrase.</p>\n<p>\"Did you come just for work? It's not something you usually do, it's not your kind of deal.\"</p>\n<p>\"No. I came because I knew that if I found you here, you\u2019d need a friend to keep you company.\u201d Steffano crossed his arms slowly, not expecting a fixed answer.</p>\n<p>After a couple of seconds, Ibarra sighed, decided, and looked back at Steffano.</p>\n<p>With a smile on his face, and his sunglasses now hiding his watery eyes, he offered his hand in a handshake.</p>\n<p>\"Count me in.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"earthworm earthworm--old-syntax-first-true earthworm--old-syntax-last-false earthworm--old-syntax-hub-yes {$class}\">\n<div class=\"first earthworm__previous\" data-title=\"/\">\n\n<p><a href=\"/\">/</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"hub earthworm__hub\" data-title=\"Special Hazards Response Protocol\">\n<p><a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/hub-shrp\">Special Hazards Response Protocol</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"last earthworm__next\" data-title=\"Distractions\">\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/distracciones\">Distractions</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><br/></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/lazos\">Bonds</a>\" by XenOGax, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Between work, work and\u2026 //work//, he didn\u2019t have much time left in the week. How much of that was true and how much of it was a bad excuse in order to nor confront reality, he didn\u2019t even know, but it didn\u2019t really matter, because ever since he came back from Afghanistan, every year on the exact same day, Ibarra took the time to visit his friends.\n\n\n\n[[image lazos1.jpg]]\n\n\n\nThe agent stared at the piece of stone in front of him with an expression that was difficult to read. This was the last one he was going to visit this morning. The one he saved for last every year. He kneeled in front of it, noticing a bouquet of flowers he hadn\u2019t left. He faintly smiled at that.\n\n\n\n\"I see they are still visiting you, huh?\" He talked to the tomb. He paused, the subtle whistle of the light morning breeze being the only sound in the place. It was overwhelming.\n\n\n\n\"Your little sister must be all grown\u2026 How old is she turning this year? Seventeen? Eighteen? Mich told me she was thinking of studying photography.\" His voice began to fade alongside his smile.\n\n\n\n\"You\u2019d be\u2026 proud of her.\" The expression of the agent turned hollow and distant. He observed the tombstone in silence, clenching his teeth and frowning.\n\n\n\nEvery year was the same. He avoided the topic, he tried to face it on November 11th, he talked to some pieces of stone, and he left more hollow than he arrived. It infuriated him. With a growl and a scowl, the man balled his fist with force and hit the grass, looking away from the tombstone. He was mad. At the circumstances, at the world, at God, even. But, above all, at himself. Because of him, the mothers of his friends were left without sons. Because of him, his friend wouldn\u2019t see his sister grow. Because of him, there were less good men in the world. Simple, //he didn\u2019t do enough.//\n\n\n\nFragments of the incident were repeated in his mind over and over again like a movie, always thinking how he could have done things differently. He changed what happened in his memory, took a different step, took a different path. But even in every scenario he made up, he couldn\u2019t escape the blood, nor the screams.\n\n\n\nHis head started to feel heavy and unstable, leaving him dizzy.\n\n\n\nIbarra closed his eyes, trying to focus. It didn\u2019t matter. He didn\u2019t do things differently, and that was it. Now he had to deal with the consequences, even if he didn\u2019t know how to.\n\n\n\nHis hands and lips trembled, his breathing started to accelerate.\n\n\n\nWhen he returned from Afghanistan and got offered a job at the Foundation he didn\u2019t think twice, he needed some kind of redemption for his acts, and the job description fit the bill. But above all, he needed to //get away.// His position as an agent and emergency doctor forced him to move constantly. He would never have permanent housing, and he never had a fixed team. His work was getting showing up, helping, and then disengaging completely, then repeat the next week. And that worked for him. No time to form bonds meant he didn\u2019t have to add names to the list of visitors. He would never again be responsible for\u2026\n\n\n\nIbarra started to feel every beat of his heart thump in his ears. He felt his throat closing, at the same time that his erratic and irregular heartbeats caused him a strong and sudden sensation of nausea.\n\n\n\nThe agent raised his head slightly, reading the epitaph on the tombstone.\n\n\n\n//The risk of losing whom you love is a small price to pay to have the opportunity to help them.//\n\n\n\nThe knot in his throat and chest tightened, and he felt like the world was about to crush him with invisible walls.\n\n\n\n\u201cFigured I\u2019d find you here.\u201d\n\n\n\n[[=image lazos2.jpg]]\n\n\n\nThe agent standing in front of the tomb turned his face around suddenly, the unexpected voice snapped him out of his thoughts and his mental turmoil. Swallowing his emotions, he placed his narrow sunglasses to hide the storm that was about to unfold.

Because I should\u2019ve done more. Because I couldn\u2019t help them. Because I had to help them. Because they had a family. Because they didn\u2019t deserve to die.

style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<p><strong>2 August, 2021</strong> - <em>I think?</em><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nI\u2019m staring at a military base with a pair of binoculars. Watching a crew of GOC types load up a series of suits of armor onto a truck. I\u2019m here for a reason. This is the next step in our little war against the Foundation. But I find myself drifting back to a few days ago. Or what I assume was a few days ago.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nTime is hard to pay attention to in a world of endless books. You try living in an infinite library containing all books ever written or that would be written across the bleeding multiverse \u2013 whatever that is \u2013 and try keeping time.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nThere ain\u2019t no sun or moon or stars. Just books. And people fucking live here, there are whole ass communities in between the stacks. I ate ramen last night at a free-standing cart like they do in Japan, and it was situated in between sections for the occult philosophies of Alagadda and the histories of some place called Leng. You\u2019d think an open flame would be something the librarians discouraged here, but apparently people live their whole lives in the stacks.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nMe, I\u2019ve never been a big fan of reading. Good way to get in trouble, I\u2019ve found. It was reading what brought me to this confluence of <a href=\"/nobody-likes-a-sneak\">insurgency against the Foundation</a> and <a href=\"/nobody-s-looking-for-trouble\">aiding the escape of a four-armed person</a> what <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">knows</span> the unknown from the depths of Foundie prison. O5-0 is the only name they\u2019ll give me. Which I don\u2019t need to explain to you, isn\u2019t a fucking name. Apparently, some big shit magic guru what helped start the Foundation then got kicked out. Basically a myth until we broke them out.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nSaid four-armed myth slurped down two bowls of tonkatsu in front of me, so I\u2019d say they\u2019re very real. But then, no one remembers I exist after I leave their eyeline. Who am I? I\u2019m Lou. Ms. Nobody. But then, the only people who get to read this are me, myself, and I. So why the fuck am I introducing myself? Future me reading this, you\u2019ll have to forgive the meandering tone here. I haven\u2019t had much time to record my thoughts and I\u2019m trying to get into the swing of it again. Sue me.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nBack to the subject at hand, it\u2019s fascinating to me that O5-0 \u2013 <em>seriously, that\u2019s going to get annoying, gonna be Zero from here on out</em> \u2013 has no trouble seeing me or remembering me. Hell, they even remember my name. I didn\u2019t think that was a thing anymore. Few years on now I\u2019ve been a miasma of imperceptiveness, only lightening up when I concentrate. Sure, the odd duck has noticed me here or there, but I just put the whammy on em and that\u2019s that. S\u2019alright? S\u2019alright.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nBut this one, they know me. Sees me from across a room and waves me down. Been right disconcerting.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nWhy am I going on about this? Other than tamping down on the raging imposter syndrome and churning mass of anxiety that is my life? Zero has been around me a lot lately. \u2018Bout a month ago, me and these other blokes sneak into Site-01. Yeah, that Site-01. Big bad Foundation prison for everything they want even their own people to forget about. We go in for the express purpose of busting this fucker out. Turns out, they knows the Impasse and they knows what caused it. And if anyone can do something about it, it\u2019s them. Hence why them overwatch types locked Zero up.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nSo here we is, in the heart of multiversal knowledge and resistance to all things Jailer, with the Black Queen (<em>Don\u2019t love that name, me darling. Feels a bit up your arse.</em>) and some others, and another Nobody. Oh yeah, I\u2019m not alone. Don\u2019t have a name for him, he don\u2019t remember one \u2013 or so he says \u2013 but I call him Barry. Hates it, he does.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nGot plans we do. Or at least, they do. Don\u2019t know why I\u2019m still here. Well\u2026 that\u2019s not expressly true. I do know why I\u2019m still here.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nDRAMATIC MUSIC. THE SCREEN GOES DARK. THE CROWD GOES ALL GOOEY WITH ANTICIPATION. CUE THE FLASHBACK.</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong>Wanderers\u2019 Library \u2013 The Depository</strong><br/>\n<em>31 July, 2021</em><br/>\n<em>One week after the raid on Site-01</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>The Depository stood in the center of a sea of books, the stacks arrayed around it like a forest of the written word. But this building was different than most in the Library. Although a variety of building materials are used in the Library, the Depository is built of rough hewn stone like something out of time immemorial. A central courtyard surrounded by an oblong ring wall and a two-story building house the collection of magic and knowledge gained by this Alison Chao and others to be used as an asset in the Hand\u2019s long quiet war against the Foundation. This isn\u2019t a story about that war, not today.</p>\n<p>The structure is older than most know or care to think of. It pre-dates the Eighth Archivist\u2019s tenure. It predates the Roman Empire on most worlds. How the Black Queen came to own the building is a story in and of itself, but that is not the story we are here for today. Today is about remembrance.</p>\n<p>The Black Queen stands on a balcony overlooking the modest courtyard and the surrounding area of the stacks. She looked down on nearly a thousand mages, operatives of the Serpent\u2019s Hand, Library docents, and even the large centipede that governed the Library. They had all gathered for one thing. A funeral. She started to speak.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are not strangers to death. In our calling to fight against the oppression of the Jailers, to free magic from their iron grip, we have all lost colleagues and loved ones. I have personally lost friends and family in this conflict. But rarely do we have the wherewithal and motivation to hold a gathering such as this. In the last month, we have seen magic start to return. We know that the Jailers, against type, were the deciding factor in reversing the Impasse. We know there were teams all over the world trying to secure every advantage, totem or relic that could have made a difference. His August Personage, the Eighth Archivist, has graced us with his presence today and he tells me that members of the Jailers were even here in the Library not five weeks past, looking for a way into Alagadda.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison Chao paused here to let that fact sink in. It was common knowledge that the multiverse over, the Foundation was not to be trusted in these sacred halls.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat has not been common knowledge, is the reason behind this death of magic they have called the Impasse. The Jailers might have fought to stop the entropic destruction of all things touched by magic or the anomalous, but they had good reason to. They were covering for their own sins. The Jailers are the cause of the Impasse. Their century or more of containment has weakened the natural state of the worlds, and so almost brought about the collapse. As so many of us know, without the anomalous there is no world. And for once, the Jailers saw it the same. But their actions in light of this catastrophe were to paper over their complicity. And even so, what actions they\u2019ve taken have only stemmed the tide. The Impasse is not reversed. The dead will not come back. The relics taken by the Jailers are being used to blunt the damage. We will see some return to the old powers, yes. But how long before it happens again? The Jailers might have changed ever so slightly. They may have freed some of their prisoners that posed the least threat to their Veil. But containment \u2013 slavery \u2013 is still their status quo. If it caused the Impasse once before, then it will surely do so again.\u201d</p>\n<p>She scanned the mass of bodies, looking into the eyes of hundreds as she panned left and right. Two Nobodies stood in the crowd, next to a four-armed individual of indecipherable gender. All three were impossibly hard to focus on, so Chao did not bother to.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is for that reason that I have authorized a number of operations against the Jailers in the past weeks. Operations that at one time would have been considered suicide. But we have been informed of the Jailers\u2019 weakness. Their disorganization. Their self-doubt. Their internal strife. Although their cabal of overlords has kept the truth to themselves about the cause of the Impasse, it is an open secret. We even have seen new resistance from within. And so, we committed to operations that would not even have been considered before. Because now is the time to bring them into the light, so they can die where we all see them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chao lowered her gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnfortunately, despite the Jailers\u2019 disorganization in the wake of the crisis, they still present a serious danger to our people. We are gathered here to mourn our fallen. And one more who fell due to the Impasse as a whole. We say their names so we might remember their deeds and their contribution to the cause.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKimori Quan Chi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMelissa Acherman.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShalid Margossian.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChlo\u00e9 Allard.\u201d</p>\n<p>The crowd intoned each name after her, a thousand voices strong. And then she paused again before the fifth and final name.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd one more we do not know the name of. Many of us have called him <a href=\"/scp-4999\">Thanatos</a>, as the Greeks might have called him. But he was the Grim Reaper and Charon too. Not a figure to be shunned or hated or feared, but a source of hope in the darkness of dying. We have recovered documentation from the Jailers that he too has fallen, disincorporated by the entropic effect of the Impasse. Many a dying soul has been shown the comfort of a caring universe by his presence in their last moments. But, most likely, there was no one to welcome him into the pale lands when it was his time. I wanted to honor his memory, because like so many things and people made up of wonder, they are gone from us now.\u201d</p>\n<p>The crowd was silent, most of which with bowed heads.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf any of you want to come up and speak of those we are here to remember, I welcome you to do so now. This has been a hard time for us all, and will be harder still. I wanted to come together and show us all what we\u2019re fighting for. So no more of us are locked away by the Jailers. So no more dead and forgotten gods are cemented over by the Jailers\u2019 endless hunger for their arbitrary status quo. Thank you all for coming. It means the world to me.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p>The two Nobodies broke off from the crowd and met the Black Queen on her descent of the stone steps within the library. The individual known as O5-0 trailed behind, along with <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/of-an-endless-hunt\">Amy Corvin</a>. They follow the Queen into a side room away from the stream of people starting up the stairs to share their memories of the fallen.</p>\n<p>The room contained a sleek conference table, already covered with tomes and documents. The Queen sat at the head of the table and indicated the rest to find seats.</p>\n<p>\u201cI appreciate you coming to this. Especially you,\u201d she said, nodding to Zero.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe very least I could do, given your assistance in freeing me from my wayward colleagues.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know this has been a lot for you, I can\u2019t imagine your perspective, but I need to know you\u2019re in this fight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have been <em>in the fight</em> for longer than you\u2019ve been alive, Ms. Chao.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. I just need to know where we\u2019re all at. Getting you out was only a first step in a new facet of this long war.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was imprisoned by Overwatch for my activities in trying to stem the tide of the Impasse.\u201d</p>\n<p>The female Nobody spoke, reminding Chao she was there. She shook her head slightly, as if trying to shake out the disorientation.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d the Nobody asked.</p>\n<p>Zero, with apparently no difficulty, focused their eyes on the woman.</p>\n<p>\u201cI stole one of their artifacts and was in the process of stealing more. The Council gathered four artifacts of prodigious thaumaturgical potency. They did this in an end run gambit to stymie the worst of the Impasse. Despite my clear warnings that it was the systemic containment of the anomalous that was the cause.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did they find these artifacts?\u201d Corvin asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told them about them, in a round about manner. Many years ago I had an office within the organization, and many materials were left behind when I fled from the Council. I did that because I knew they would not take my warnings seriously. And I will admit, when I realized that my notes on several artifacts that could be used to dampen the entropy and slow, possibly even halt, the death of the anomalous, I thought it was a good thing they were in their hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit, why would that be a good thing?\u201d Corvin asked, half rising from her seat. Chao placed a hand on her young friend\u2019s shoulder and gently pushed her back down.</p>\n<p>\u201cAmy has the mouth of a sailor, but she has similar concerns as I do,\u201d Chao said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought that if anyone could hunt down four legendary prisms of unrestrained thaumaturgy, it was the Foundation. And I was right. When the Impasse started to show its effect on the world, when things started to quietly die that should not ever do so, I wormed my way back into the Foundation. I infiltrated and made myself appear as a researcher. I clued in the Council to the existence of the notes, as they had sealed up my office and pretended I never existed, and planted the seed of a plan. I thought to sweep in, gather up the artifacts under their noses and use them for my own purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t work as well as you hoped,\u201d Nobody said.</p>\n<p>Chao noticed the other Nobody was silent in his reverie; despite his impetus in forming this little cabal \u2013 having called all those here together in the first place \u2013 he was strangely quiet.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes and no,\u201d Zero said. They placed two of their palms flat on the table, crossing the other two arms across their chest. \u201cI wanted to use the artifacts to stem the entropy, and that is what the Council is doing. As potent as these artifacts are as weapons, and they are without a doubt weapons, their greatest utility is damming up the flow of the Impasse. So, it worked in the sense that the Council is using them for the purposes I foresaw their potential to be. But they discovered me and imprisoned me. I got through to some of them, sat in the room with them and convinced nearly half the Council to walk away from containment. To shut down the Foundation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think those you convinced would be willing to work against the organization?\u201d Chao asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s hard to say. My gut says no, that voting against the Foundation is not the same as betraying it. But it might be worth some reconnaissance of those who voted in favor of dissolution.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know who voted against?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cO5s three, six, seven, eleven and twelve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know a lot about them as individuals,\u201d Corvin said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can fill you in to some extent, at least enough to get started,\u201d Zero responded.</p>\n<p>\u201cMore research. Great,\u201d the female Nobody said.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you have something in mind, Lou?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chao narrowed her eyes at this. Wondered how Zero knew a name for Nobody. The woman also found it obviously disconcerting, and that confusion cleared up a little more of the fog around her. Chao could see the Nobody clearly for a moment, ringed in red curls. But when she spoke, she did not comment on Zero\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we got you out, you said you wanted to shut them down. How do you shut down the O5s?\u201d Nobody asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe witty answer would be \u2018carefully\u2019 but I think you want more details than that,\u201d Zero said. \u201cWe divide them. Find the chinks in the organizational armor and I assure they exist, and then apply pressure. Some violence will almost certainly be required.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<p>Breaking in here to say I don\u2019t mind a good scrap. Hell, I grew up in London. Can\u2019t go anywhere without a baton or a blade these days. But I\u2019d be lying if I said I was relishing another gun fight with the Foundies and their death squads.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nDespite my ability to sneak into almost any sort of secret bunker, I haven\u2019t often utilized my \u201ccondition\u201d for violence. That being said, nothing sorts out an authoritative regime better than a knife in the right set of ribs.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Chao nodded, contemplating Zero\u2019s words. \u201cSo, do you think reattaining the artifacts would be worth pursuing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, they are serving a purpose now,\u201d Zero said. \u201cNo one wants the Impasse to continue less than I. But they weren\u2019t alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Corvin asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere were other artifacts that I thought could be used to serve the same function, and some of those would be useful to secure. If only to keep them out of the Foundation\u2019s cells.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chao turned to the silent Nobody, annoyed by his reticence.</p>\n<p>\u201cWere you going to participate in this meeting you facilitated? Your colleague seems engaged. You have been silent.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was waiting to see how long it took for any of you to notice that we aren\u2019t alone,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zero said. The other Nobody nodded to the corner of the room, draped in shadows.</p>\n<p>\u201cSon of a bitch. I knew I couldn\u2019t trust Placeholder,\u201d a disembodied voice said from the corner.</p>\n<p>Zero narrowed their eyes on the darkened corner of the room and raised a hand, forming a series of sigils in the air with rapidity. A <a href=\"/scp-5616\">woman</a> with short, wavy reddish hair and wearing glasses and a slim jumpsuit wavered into being.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight. This is awkward. Let\u2019s start with introductions. My name is Ilse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Female Nobody \u2013 <em>what was her name again?</em> \u2013 and Corvin had guns in hand, pointed at the new arrival.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean any harm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why you sneaking about like a bleeding ninja?\u201d the female Nobody said.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s Foundation,\u201d Zero said.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot exactly!\u201d the woman exclaimed.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot possible,\u201d Chao said. \u201cHow could someone from the Foundation find their way in here? And hide from us, in this way?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Zero said.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s very good,\u201d the male Nobody said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, thank you. Very helpful,\u201d Chao said narrowing her eyes and looking sideways at the Nobody. She turned back towards the woman in the corner. \u201cExplain yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlso, what did you mean when you said you couldn\u2019t trust a placeholder?\u201d the other Nobody said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take those one at a time. First, Placeholder is a person. Long story short, he had his name stolen by <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5242\">a magical whatsit</a> and he gets to walk around with one of the most ridiculous names someone could imagine. He is one of the most important experts in something the Foundation calls Pataphysics.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d Corvin said.</p>\n<p>Chao frowned. \u201cLet her finish. Don\u2019t interrupt again, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you. Listen, I don\u2019t want to bore you more than you already are, but pataphysics is the study of narrative in dictating the operations of the universe. I think. Suffice it to say that Placeholder told me that this device,\u201d she held up her hand to show a bracelet made of smokey gray metal, \u201cwould deemphasize my protagonistic potential to such a degree that I would disappear into the background.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<p>I shit you not, this is what she said. Protagonistic potential. Jesus.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\u201cSorry\u2026 your what?\u201d the female Nobody asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, what it was supposed to do was make me much much less noticeable so I could observe without interfering.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPersonally, I do not care how you were hiding in the corner, Ilse,\u201d Zero said. \u201cI am a fugitive from the Foundation and here we find you, an agent of that same Foundation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, not really. I\u2019m not an agent of the Foundation as you understand it. I\u2019m the director of the TAD. I shouldn\u2019t be telling you any of this. But, we\u2019re not super interested in containment or locking up anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen what are you interested in?\u201d Zero asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaintaining the timeline.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe what now?\u201d the female Nobody asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cA chronological arrangement of events in the order of their occurrence in the simplest meaning, but in a world of alternate realities, it\u2019s a specific arrangement,\u201d Zero said. \u201cOne of many. In other words, another dimension or a different versions of our universe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, there are different version of us out there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely. But there is only one Wanderer\u2019s Library, and it connects to all of those other worlds.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, most of them anyway. It\u2019s hard to say for sure if all universes connect to the Library,\u201d Chao said.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeggin the question: How does this \u2018TAD\u2019 maintain a fawking timeline? What does TAD even stand for?\u201d the Nobody asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Temporal Anomalies Department,\u201d Ilse said. \u201cWe mostly monitor anomalies that directly affect the arrangement of events and interfere with the Prime Timeline, the most stable. If the multiverse is the branches of a tree, then the Prime Timeline is the trunk. So, yes, we are the Foundation, but we aren\u2019t interested in locking up murder monsters or interfering with the Hand, we are entirely focused on combating a number of retrocausal, temporal and ahistorical events that are caused by anomalies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t explain why you are here, why you infiltrated my private space, and why you were skulking around like a home invader?\u201d Alison asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor one thing, what you five are discussing has a significant impact on the following years. I couldn\u2019t help but see it for myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018For one thing?\u2019 What else?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAccording to our records, I was supposed to be here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d the male Nobody asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo a very limited extent, my department is able to traverse the time stream. It\u2019s necessary to preserve the timeline. The TAD exists outside the timelines, by way of a bunch of technical jargon I won\u2019t be explaining. Effectively, you are in my past. In my present, we have technical details concerning the events following the vote of the O5 Council and Zero\u2019s escape from custody afterwards. One of those details is that I was present. Which isn\u2019t technically possible.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<p>If I had to read this, I\u2019d get real sick of me or someone else asking \u201cwhat?\u201d because half the stuff this bird said made no sense. Every other word out of her mouth was bloody gibberish. I guess it showed on my face, cos she went on.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\u201cLong story short, <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5616\">I only recently freed myself</a> from a sort of containment that\u2019s held me underground for the better part of the 20th century. I\u2019m still there, underground in Canada. Actually, today I am giving a presentation on ***.\u201d</p>\n<p>The TAD Director ended the sentence with a screeching that sounded like metal tearing apart. Everyone in the room flinched, except Zero.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat in the fuck was that?\u201d Corwin said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere must be a memetic filter on that presentation. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s been a long time since I had to worry about clearances. Suffice it to say that I wasn\u2019t in the Wanderer\u2019s Library on this day, talking to you. But that\u2019s what the TAD\u2019s records say, so\u2026 I figured I\u2019d sit in the shadows and see if a different version of me showed up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t consider that the version of you that would appear, was you?\u201d Zero asked.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<p>At this point, I had the worst headache of me bleeding life. Even thinking of this conversation makes my head hurt.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\u201cIt did, but I thought that was an outside possibility. To be honest, I\u2019m still thinking that other version of me wanders in any minute. You should know what that feels like, Ms. Chao.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how it works with my sister selves,\u201d Alison responded.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a poor attempt at a joke.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did your records say you were here to say?\u201d the male Nobody asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus. I forgot you were here. I hate that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s no bloody fun for us either, lady,\u201d the female Nobody said.</p>\n<p>\u201cApologies, I don\u2019t mean to be insensitive. Why I\u2019m here\u2026 well, I guess, to sell out the Foundation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alison gaped at her, she could see everyone else\u2019s reaction was similar.</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<p>Just imagine I said \u201cWhat?!?!\u201d again.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s not the most predictable path for an agent of the Foundation but apparently, I give you information on the whereabouts of three Overseers and several pieces of equipment that will help you in your endeavor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would you help us?\u201d Alison asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe TAD might be part of the Foundation, but it is entirely outside the command structure. We follow our own prerogatives and march to our own drum. The way the O5s have handled the Impasse leaves a lot to be desired. And apparently, it\u2019s already happened so\u2026 despite the fact I have misgivings, I will provide you with the information.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn exchange for what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA few minutes of your time for some questions concerning your sisterhood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alison considered for a moment. She could see Amy Corvin\u2019s head shake in her peripheral vision as the young woman tried desperately to get her attention. She met Zero\u2019s eyes across the table and they shrugged ever so slightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI imagine the Foundation already knows everything it needs to concerning your special condition,\u201d Zero said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI promise to keep everything confidential. Anything related to the Impasse is not even on review by the O5s.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re incredibly transparent, Dr. Reynders,\u201d Zero said.</p>\n<p>Ilse startled.</p>\n<p>\u201cApologies, I have been aware of your predicament for several decades. When you mentioned your name and your recent incarceration, I put two and two together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re very well informed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI began your organization over a hundred years ago, my good doctor. I tend to keep tabs on them. But don\u2019t dissemble. Why are you being so apparently forthcoming with us, the enemies of your Foundation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs I said, I don\u2019t agree with how Overwatch handled the crisis. I don\u2019t appreciate the way they treated you. We are supposed to contain threats to normalcy, not people who disagree with our policies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am a threat to normalcy. A significant one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ilse chuckled. \u201cI have no doubt. But my point is, the Foundation has been overly concerned with locking up threats to their organization. Things and people that aren\u2019t a threat to anyone\u2019s life but <em>do</em> imperil the Foundation\u2019s power and authority. And for another reason, anything said within this building is null and void.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zero turned and looked at Alison. \u201cWhat does she mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have considerable reason to be paranoid these days,\u201d Alison said. \u201cThis building has a geas placed upon it. Anyone entering that wishes to report what occurs here in a way that would provide information for my enemies will find themselves completely unable to communicate the information.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t even be able to confirm to someone that I was here if they demanded I do so, if it was to work against the Queen or the Hand in general,\u201d Ilse said. \u201cSo, no one at the Foundation will know that it was this me that told you anything. Only that a version of me, free from my incarceration as you called it, appeared today to aid in the conversation. And even then, the only with access to those files are people in the TAD who don\u2019t care.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery well, provide your information and I will answer your questions, within reason,\u201d Alison said.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent! So, the first thing I\u2019ll tell you is the name of <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7007\">O5-7: Marjorie Gonzales</a>. And I can tell you where to find her too.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<p>And at this point she starts listing off details about a number of O5s and then gives a debriefing on some assets that would help in <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">taking out</span></strong> capturing the Overseers. Honestly, it\u2019s terribly boring stuff. Let\u2019s move on. I\u2019m pretty sure someone was writing it down.</p>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"page\">\n<p>With my condition, you can imagine it\u2019s easy to lose someone\u2019s focus.

Zero is taking notes, and animatedly discussing strategies with Barry and Corwin. They start to file out of the room and just as she gets to the door, Corwin looks back at Chao \u2013 who proceeds to wave her off.

was different than most in the Library.\u00a0\u00a0Although a variety of building materials are used in the Library, the Depository is built of rough hewn stone like something out of time immemorial.\u00a0\u00a0A central courtyard surrounded by an oblong ring wall and a two-story building house the collection of magic and knowledge gained by this Alison Chao and others to be used as an asset in the Hand\u2019s long quiet war against the Foundation.\u00a0\u00a0This isn\u2019t a story about that war, not today.\n\n\n\nThe structure is older than most know or care to think of.\u00a0\u00a0It pre-dates the Eighth Archivist\u2019s tenure.\u00a0\u00a0It predates the Roman Empire on most worlds.\u00a0\u00a0How the Black Queen came to own the building is a story in and of itself, but that is not the story we are here for today.\u00a0\u00a0Today is about remembrance.\n\n\n\nThe Black Queen stands on a balcony overlooking the modest courtyard and the surrounding area of the stacks.\u00a0\u00a0She looked down on nearly a thousand mages, operatives of the Serpent\u2019s Hand, Library docents, and even the large centipede that governed the Library.\u00a0\u00a0They had all gathered for one thing.\u00a0\u00a0A funeral.\u00a0\u00a0She started to speak.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are not strangers to death.\u00a0\u00a0In our calling to fight against the oppression of the Jailers,

and motivation to hold a gathering such as this.\u00a0\u00a0In the last month, we have seen magic start to return.\u00a0\u00a0We know that the Jailers, against type, were the deciding factor in reversing the Impasse.\u00a0\u00a0We know there were teams all over the world trying to secure every advantage, totem or relic that could have made a difference.\u00a0\u00a0His August Personage, the Eighth Archivist, has graced us with his presence today and he tells me that members of the Jailers were even here in the Library not five weeks past, looking for a way into Alagadda.\u201d\n\n\n\nAllison Chao paused here to let that fact sink in.\u00a0\u00a0It was common knowledge that the multiverse over, the Foundation was not to be trusted in these sacred halls.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat has not been common knowledge, is the reason behind this death of magic they have called the Impasse.\u00a0\u00a0The Jailers might have fought to stop the entropic destruction of all things touched by magic or the anomalous, but they had good reason to.\u00a0\u00a0They were covering for their own sins.\u00a0\u00a0The Jailers are the cause of the Impasse.\u00a0\u00a0Their century or more of containment has weakened the natural state of the worlds, and so almost brought about the collapse.\u00a0\u00a0As so many of us know, without the anomalous there is no world.\u00a0\u00a0And for once, the Jailers saw it the same.\u00a0\u00a0But their actions in light of this catastrophe were to paper over their complicity.\u00a0\u00a0And even so, what actions they\u2019ve taken have only stemmed the tide.\u00a0\u00a0The Impasse is not reversed.\u00a0\u00a0The dead will not come back.\u00a0\u00a0The relics taken by the Jailers are being used to blunt the damage.\u00a0\u00a0We will see some return to the old powers, yes.\u00a0\u00a0But how long before it happens again?\u00a0\u00a0The Jailers might have changed ever so slightly.\u00a0\u00a0They may have freed some of their prisoners that posed the least threat to their Veil.\u00a0\u00a0But containment \u2013 slavery \u2013 is still their status quo.\u00a0\u00a0If it caused the Impasse once before, then it will surely do so again.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe scanned the mass of bodies, looking into the eyes of hundreds as she panned left and right.\u00a0\u00a0Two Nobodies stood in the crowd, next to a four-armed individual of indecipherable gender.\u00a0\u00a0All three were impossibly hard to focus on, so Chao did not bother to.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is for that reason that I have authorized a number of operations against the Jailers in the past weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Operations that at one time would have been considered suicide.\u00a0\u00a0But we have been informed of the Jailers\u2019 weakness.\u00a0\u00a0Their disorganization.\u00a0\u00a0Their self-doubt.\u00a0\u00a0Their internal strife.\u00a0\u00a0Although their cabal of overlords has kept the truth to themselves about the cause of the Impasse, it is an open secret.\u00a0\u00a0We even have seen new resistance from within.\u00a0\u00a0And so, we committed to operations that would not even have been considered before.\u00a0\u00a0Because now is the time to bring them into the light, so they can die where we all see them.\u201d\n\n\n\nChao lowered her gaze.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, despite the

seats.\n\n\n\n\u201cI appreciate you coming to this.\u00a0\u00a0Especially you,\u201d she said, nodding to Zero.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cThe very least I could do, given your assistance in freeing me from my wayward colleagues.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know this has been a lot for you, I can\u2019t imagine your perspective, but I need to know you\u2019re in this fight.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI have been //in the fight// for longer than you\u2019ve been alive, Ms. Chao.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cGood.\u00a0\u00a0I just need to know where we\u2019re all at.\u00a0\u00a0Getting you out was only a first step in a new facet of this long war.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI was imprisoned by Overwatch for my activities in trying to stem the tide of the Impasse.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe female Nobody spoke, reminding Chao she was there.\u00a0\u00a0She shook her head slightly, as if trying to shake out the disorientation.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d the Nobody asked.\n\n\n\nZero, with apparently no difficulty, focused their eyes on the woman.\n\n\n\n\u201cI stole one of their artifacts and was in the process of stealing more.\u00a0\u00a0The Council gathered four artifacts of prodigious thaumaturgical potency.\u00a0\u00a0They did this in an end run gambit to stymie the worst of the Impasse.\u00a0\u00a0Despite my clear warnings that it was the systemic containment of the anomalous that was the cause.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHow did they find these artifacts?\u201d Corvin asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cI told them about them, in a round about manner.\u00a0\u00a0Many years ago I had an office within the organization, and many materials were left behind when I fled from the Council.\u00a0\u00a0I did that because I knew they would not take my warnings seriously.\u00a0\u00a0And I will admit, when I realized that my notes on several artifacts that could be used to dampen the entropy and slow, possibly even halt, the death of the anomalous, I thought it was a good thing they were in their hands.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHoly shit, why would that be a good thing?\u201d Corvin asked, half rising from her seat.\u00a0\u00a0Chao placed a hand on her young friend\u2019s shoulder and gently pushed her back down.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmy has the mouth of a sailor, but she has similar concerns as I do,\u201d Chao said.\n\n\n\n\u201cI thought that if anyone could hunt down four legendary prisms of unrestrained thaumaturgy, it was the Foundation.\u00a0\u00a0And I was right.\u00a0\u00a0When the Impasse started to show its effect on the world, when things started to quietly die that should not ever do so, I wormed my way back into the Foundation.\u00a0\u00a0I infiltrated and made myself appear as a researcher.\u00a0\u00a0I clued in the Council to the existence of the notes, as they had sealed up my office and pretended I never existed, and planted the seed of a plan.\u00a0\u00a0I thought to sweep in, gather up the artifacts under their noses and use them for my own purposes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t work as well as you hoped,\u201d Nobody said.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nChao noticed the other Nobody was silent in his reverie; despite his impetus in forming this little cabal \u2013 having called all those here together in the first place \u2013 he was strangely quiet.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes and no,\u201d Zero said.\u00a0\u00a0They placed two of their palms flat on the table, crossing the other two arms across their chest.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI wanted to use the artifacts to stem the entropy, and that is what the Council is doing.\u00a0\u00a0As potent as these artifacts are as weapons, and they are without a doubt weapons, their greatest utility is damming up the flow of the Impasse.\u00a0\u00a0So, it worked in the sense that the Council is using them for the purposes I foresaw their potential to be.\u00a0\u00a0But they discovered me and imprisoned me.\u00a0\u00a0I got through to some of them, sat in the room with them and convinced nearly half the Council to walk away from containment.\u00a0\u00a0To shut down the Foundation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you think those you convinced would be willing to work against the organization?\u201d Chao asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s hard to say.\u00a0\u00a0My gut says no, that voting against the Foundation is not the same as betraying it.\u00a0\u00a0But it might be worth some reconnaissance of those who voted in favor of dissolution.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you know who voted against?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cO5s three, six, seven, eleven and twelve.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know a lot about them as individuals,\u201d Corvin said.\n\n\n\n\u201cI can fill you in to some extent, at least enough to get started,\u201d Zero responded.\n\n\n\n\u201cMore research.\u00a0\u00a0Great,\u201d the female Nobody said.\n\n\n\n\u201cDid you have something in mind, Lou?\u201d \n\n\n\nChao narrowed her eyes at this.\u00a0\u00a0Wondered how Zero knew a name for Nobody.\u00a0\u00a0The woman also found it obviously disconcerting, and that confusion cleared up a little more of the fog around her.\u00a0\u00a0Chao could see the Nobody clearly for a moment, ringed in red curls.\u00a0\u00a0But when she spoke, she did not comment on Zero\u2019s knowledge.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen we got you out, you said you wanted to shut them down.\u00a0\u00a0How do you shut down the O5s?\u201d Nobody asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe witty answer would be \u2018carefully\u2019 but I think you want more details than that,\u201d Zero said.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe divide them.\u00a0\u00a0Find the chinks in the organizational armor and I assure they exist, and then apply pressure.\u00a0\u00a0Some violence will almost certainly be required.\u201d\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n\nBreaking in here to say I

words.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo, do you think reattaining the artifacts would be worth pursuing?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, they are serving a purpose now,\u201d Zero said.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo one wants the Impasse to continue less than I.\u00a0\u00a0But they weren\u2019t alone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Corvin asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere were other artifacts that I thought could be used to serve the same function, and some of those would be useful to secure.\u00a0\u00a0If only to keep them out of the Foundation\u2019s cells.\u201d\n\n\n\nChao turned to the silent Nobody, annoyed by his reticence.\n\n\n\n\u201cWere you going to participate in this meeting you facilitated?\u00a0\u00a0Your colleague seems engaged.\u00a0\u00a0You have been silent.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI was waiting to

draped in shadows.\n\n\n\n\u201cSon of a bitch.\u00a0\u00a0I knew I couldn\u2019t trust Placeholder,\u201d a disembodied voice said from the corner.\n\n\n\nZero narrowed their eyes on the darkened

I mean, ma\u2019am. I mean, doctor,\u201d he said miserably. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s been six months since my girlfriend left me, and I\u2019ve been working really long hours, and all the good sites are blocked from the network here, and \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr. Gruber closed her eyes, pinched the bridge of her nose, and waved her other hand to cut him off. \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, <em>please</em> stop trying to justify yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir. Doctor. I\u2019m sorry, doctor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I asked \u2018what were you <em>thinking?!</em>\u2019, that was rhetorical. I don\u2019t need all these details about your\u2026 private habits.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, sir. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>She squinted at him. \u201cAre you\u2026 are you <em>crying</em>?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! No. \u2026 M-m-maybe a little. I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry!\u201d His voice went up into a squeak, and tears were streaming down his cheeks.</p>\n<p>She sighed, and held out a box of tissues. His eyes widened in horror, and she suddenly realized what else he might have intended using a box of tissues for. She winced.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Blow your nose,</em>\u201d she said flatly. \u201cWipe your face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d He blushed again, but took the tissues from her.</p>\n<p>Gruber drummed her fingers on her desk impatiently, watching as the guard cleaned himself up. \u201cAre you always this emotionally fragile?\u201d she asked him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I mean\u2026 not in a crisis situation. If the site was on fire, or if some monster had gotten loose, I\u2019d be totally calm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to understand that the only reason you are not in worse trouble is that you recognized this as a change in the anomaly, and reported it immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. Thank you, ma\u2019am. Sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>are</em> still in trouble, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 yes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, relax. You\u2019re not fired.\u201d</p>\n<p>The guard sat up straight.</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst offense,\u201d Gruber went on. \u201cReport to Nancy McDougall in HR tomorrow afternoon. Your pay will be docked for\u2026 probably a year, you\u2019ll have to take some training courses, you might be reassigned to a different site.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. Thank you, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gruber paused as a thought struck her.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis <em>is</em> your first offense, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>She hadn\u2019t thought it was possible for the guard to blush any harder. \u201cWell, uh, last year, my girlfriend, my ex-girlfriend, I guess, she would, uh, call me while I was, uh, on duty, and we would, uh \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Gruber held up a hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>meant</em>, have you used the SCP before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! No, never.\u201d</p>\n<p>She indicated the CD-ROM sitting in its plastic case on her desk. \u201cHow did you even find out about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>The guard shrugged. \u201cThere were rumors? I mean\u2026 people talk. Especially about things like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gruber slumped. \u201cYou never heard of infosec?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but\u2026 we all have clearance, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter you\u2019ve been to HR, you need to have a long talk with the people at RAISA.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Dr. Mancini knocked at the open door to Gruber\u2019s office. \u201cGood afternoon, Vera. You wanted to see me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Pasquale. Come in. Before I explain what this is about, I need to tell you that I am <em>not</em> propositioning you. This is not any kind of flirtation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mancini\u2019s eyebrows went up. \u201cI would hope not,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure my husband would be very upset.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLast night, a guard reported a substantial change to a contained artifact. I had a quick glance afterward \u2013 enough to confirm that he wasn\u2019t just making shit up. But I think\u2026 I think it needs to have more than one person look into it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you thought I\u2019d perceive that as <em>flirting?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Gruber gave a thin smile. \u201cIt\u2019s <a href=\"/scp-1004\">SCP-1004</a>, so I figured I\u2019d be on the safe side.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne zero zero four. Hm. Not ringing a bell\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Mancini pulled his tablet out of his pocket and tapped rapidly on the screen, then read the first few paragraphs of the results. \u201cUh\u2026 wow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, \u2018wow\u2019 is right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did he even have it out of its containment locker?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gruber looked at him. \u201cWhy do you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. Right. Where is he now? Fired?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I sent him to talk to HR. He did report the change to me immediately, and I suppose there are worse ways he could have abused artifacts. Poor dumbass was mortified. He actually started crying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re too nice. Wait, holy shit, someone actually suggested we use 1004 to <em>blackmail</em> people?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep. Assuming we could record its output, anyway. Which we can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mancini shook his head. \u201cWhat kind of idiot would actually write that down in a formal document with their name attached to it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I wondered about that. You\u2019ll never guess who it was.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mancini looked puzzled. \u201cShould I know?\u201d</p>\n<p>At her desk, Gruber clicked the option to show the document\u2019s history. \u201cAdam Dale,\u201d she said, indicating the screen.</p>\n<p>Mancini blinked. \u201cAs in, Incident 1004-Dale? <em>That</em> Adam Dale?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep. His fingerprints are all over this. All over the document, I mean. The actual artifact looks\u2026 reasonably clean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mancini raised his index finger. \u201cY\u2019know \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Gruber cut him off. \u201cWhatever joke you were about to make, assume I\u2019ve already thought of it and decided it was disgusting, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mancini sighed and nodded. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the change?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently, it used to be just a command prompt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018What would you like to see\u2019, right. But now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Instead of answering, Gruber pressed the button to open her desktop\u2019s CD drive, and inserted the disk. A window popped up on the screen, with one file in it.</p>\n<p>\u201cReady?\u201d she asked.</p>\n<p>Mancini leaned on the desk so he could get a better view.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, go ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gruber moused over the icon for TheFactory.exe, and double-clicked on it.</p>\n<p>The screen went blank, then filled with a rendering of the Factory\u2019s logo in ASCII art. It slowly faded away, and a text box appeared.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><tt><strong><em>THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING TO USE FACTORY P.O.R.N., THE PORNOMANTIC OMNIVERSAL RETRIEVAL NEXUS, DESPITE THE INTRODUCTION OF GENERATIVE A.I.

What happens next?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t know, that\u2019s as far as I got before I shut it down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the only change, I\u2019m going to be making fun of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gruber pressed the spacebar. The screen blanked again, then presented them with three options.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><tt><strong>1:</strong> FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (F.A.Q.)</tt><br/>\n<tt><strong>2:</strong> CHANGELOG AND COMMUNITY NOTES</tt><br/>\n<tt><strong>3:</strong> get to the good stuff!</tt><br/>\n<tt>&lt;press \u20181\u2019, \u20182\u2019, or \u20183\u2019 to select your option, or use your computer\u2019s mouse&gt;</tt></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u201cYeah, here we go,\u201d she said. \u201cThe guard said first it bitched about AI art, then it offered to answer his questions, and mentioned a community, and that\u2019s when he realized something was wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s be methodical,\u201d Mancini said, and reached out and pressed \u20181\u2019 on the keyboard.</p>\n<p>The screen blanked again, then presented them with text.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><tt><strong>FACTORY P.O.R.N.

She returned to the main menu, then clicked on the \u2018get to the good stuff!\u2019 link.</p>\n<p>Mancini side-eyed her. \u201cVera, please, I don\u2019t want my friend to turn into a sex monster.\u201d</p>\n<p>She waved that off. \u201cOne, the file says upwards of a hundred hours of exposure.

Gruber shook her head. \u201cThey did say they\u2019d be deleting all the posts, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s see the FAQ?\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p><tt><strong>Q:</strong> I want to share Factory P.O.R.N with my friends. Why can\u2019t I send them copies of the application?</tt></p>\n<p><tt><strong>A</strong>: It\u2019s proprietary! Plus, for obvious reasons, we\u2019d rather be able to control how many copies of the Nexus are open at any given time, so saving the file to your hard drive, or including it as an attachment in an e-mail message or an IM, will result in an unactivatable bitstring. Don\u2019t worry, you can give us your friends\u2019 mailing addresses, and we\u2019ll send them their own copies of Factory P.O.R.N. on floppy diskette or CD-ROM! &lt;wink&gt;</tt><br/>\n<tt><strong>Update:</strong> As of January 1, 2005, we will no longer be providing Factory P.O.R.N. on floppy diskette.</tt><br/>\n<tt><strong>Update:</strong> As of January 1, 2011, we will no longer be providing Factory P.O.R.N. on CD-ROM; however, we will be providing it on USB drives.</tt><br/>\n<tt><strong>Update:</strong> Due to issues with our USB drive supplier, we will continue providing Factory P.O.R.N. on CD-ROM until July 1, 2011.</tt><br/>\n<tt><strong>Update:</strong> Factory P.O.R.N. on USB drives will not be available until January 1, 2013.</tt><br/>\n<tt><strong>Update:</strong> We\u2019re hoping for 2014.</tt><br/>\n<tt><strong>Update:</strong> 2017.</tt><br/>\n<tt><strong>Update:</strong> Don't ask. We'll let you know.</tt></p>\n<p><tt><strong>Q:</strong> I want to share Factory P.O.R.N with my friends. Why can\u2019t I send them copies of the videos, or save them to my computer\u2019s hard drive and watch them again afterward?</tt><br/>\n<tt><strong>A:</strong> You can, if you upgrade to <em>Premium Factory P.O.R.N.</em> for $499.95 US! <em>Premium Factory P.O.R.N.</em> also includes the ability to make more detailed requests (maximum 1500 words instead of 300), and the ability to request variations on a specific video instead of doing an entire new search. Send a check or postal money order to The Factory.</tt><br/>\n<tt><strong>Update:</strong> We\u2019ve joined PayPal! It\u2019s a new service for processing online payments!</tt></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><tt><strong>Q:</strong> How does Factory P.O.R.N. work?</tt></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u201cOh wait,\u201d Mancini said. \u201cWhat\u2019s this one?\u201d</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><tt><strong>A:</strong> The details are proprietary, but here\u2019s a simplified version:</tt></p>\n<p><tt>TheFactory.exe is a 17-layered recursively self-casting compressed cantrip. Each layer casts the next, until the final layer generates the Retrieval Agent and opens the Pornomantic Omniversal Retrieval Nexus.</tt></p>\n<p><tt>The Retrieval Agent then searches the omniverse until it has located no less than 50 videos that meet your description, produces \u201cthumbnail\u201d images for you to choose from, and then plays them on the occipital lobe of your brain.</tt></p>\n<p><tt>The search algorithm functions in a time dimension that\u2019s perpendicular to the one we live in, so even if it takes a centillion years to find what you\u2019ve asked for, your results will be presented to you instantly!</tt></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u201cAh!\u201d Gruber said. \u201cThat explains a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mancini glared at her. \u201cNo it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>She shrugged. \u201cAgree to disagree. How about Community Notes?\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p><tt>Here are the winners of the \u201cTop Ten Reasons Factory P.O.R.N. is Better than Generative AI\u201d essay contest! Because only six people submitted entries, all six of you win!</tt></p>\n<p><tt><strong>1:</strong> <em>USING FACTORY PORN IS BETTER THEN USING GENERATION A.I. BECAUSE, ITS WHAT I WAS DOING FIRST.</em> - by [ACCOUNT DELETED]</tt></p>\n<p><tt><strong>2:</strong> Using Factory Porn is more <em>intellectually honest</em> than generative AI, because nobody really knows how generative AI works. It\u2019s a \u201cblack box\u201d that could do <em>anything!</em> With Factory Porn, we <em>know</em> it\u2019s just the Retrieval Agent searching and finding. - by [ACCOUNT DELETED]</tt></p>\n<p><tt><strong>3:</strong> Generative AI is trained on a corpus of pre-existing content, but all of that has its own copyright, which the generative AI is inherently breaching because everything it makes is a derived work. But alternate universes are not party to the Berne Convention, so their copyright doesn\u2019t apply. Trust me on this, I\u2019m a lawyer. And even if it did, the Retrieval Agent can only contact a given universe once. Trust me on this, I\u2019m also a physicist. So that means that we can\u2019t transact with them except acausally, and that doesn\u2019t work. Trust me on this, I\u2019m also an economist. So we might as well just copy anything and everything from any alternate universe, because it won\u2019t matter. Trust me on this, I\u2019m also a philosopher. - by [ACCOUNT DELETED]</tt></p>\n<p><tt><strong>4:</strong> Using the Pornomantic Omniversal Retrieval Nexus is more <em>ethical</em> than generative AI. Generative AI is trained on the faces and bodies of millions of people, some of whom may not have wanted their images to be used in this way. The Pornomantic Omniversal Retrieval Nexus reaches out to a reality where your specific porn has already been made, so there are no consent issues! - by [ACCOUNT DELETED]</tt></p>\n<p><tt><strong>5:</strong> The Pornomatic Omniversal Retrieval Nexus is <em>esthetically superior</em> to using generative AI. Generative AI just puts pixels together until it produces an image \u2013 but there was never any actual person involved. Every single video the Nexus retrieves was made by, with, and for real people. - by [ACCOUNT DELETED]</tt></p>\n<p><tt><strong>6:</strong> The use of generative AI for the real-time bespoke production of high-resolution full-length videos would have an unacceptably high carbon footprint</tt>.</p>\n<p><tt>Each of the cantrip\u2019s 16 cycles of expansion uses approximately 17 picojoules. The final cantrip opens the Pornomantic Omniversal Retrieval Nexus, and uses approximately 84\u00a0000 picojoules. By contrast, using a 40-watt lightbulb for 1 second uses 40\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0000 picojoules. That\u2019s 474 billion times more, every single second. The entire population of the Earth is less than 12 billion. Just to surpass that one 40-watt bulb burning for 1 second, every single one of us would have to be opening TheFactory.exe 35 times a second. - by [ACCOUNT DELETED]</tt></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mancini frowned. \u201cThere\u2019s a hole in the logic for number four.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe idea that, just because the porn exists, that means everyone involved was consenting?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gruber winced. \u201cChrist, you had to remind me. I skimmed the test logs earlier \u2013 just the metadata. Just to see what kind of stuff people were looking for. It is some serious nightmare shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mancini raised an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\"Hold on, I\u2019ll give you access.\u201d Gruber typed a few commands on her keyboard, and Mancini tapped the fresh link that appeared on his tablet.</p>\n<p>His gaze flickered across the screen. \u201cThis seems\u2026 pretty abstract?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, starting on page 8.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mancini scrolled down to page 8.

But\u2026 wait, if he was that bad all along, why did the O5s go along with it?\u201d</p>\n<p>She gazed at him for a long moment. \u201cPasquale, are you really asking why an organization would say that one of their people was the victim of psychic contamination by an anomaly instead of admit that they\u2019d let a sex monster hold a position of authority for over six years?\u201d</p>\n<p>He bit his lip. \u201cWell, when you put it <em>that</em> way\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>She closed her eyes and stretched her arms above her head, and cracked her knuckles. \u201cYou know what the real shame of it is?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at the dates on the access log. We\u2019ve had this thing in custody for almost thirty years, and that guard was the first one to touch it in almost <em>twenty</em> years, because we were all too scared of a bullshit cognitohazard that a sex monster made up to protect his own reputation. Think what we could have learned if we\u2019d gone on their forums and <em>talked</em> to people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mancini shook his head. \u201cYou think we would\u2019ve realized they even <em>had</em> forums?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno.

I mean, ma\u2019am. I mean, doctor,\u201d he said miserably. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s been six months since my girlfriend left me, and I\u2019ve been working really long hours, and all the good sites are blocked from the network here, and \u2013\u201d\n\n\n\nDr. Gruber closed her eyes, pinched the bridge of her nose, and waved her other hand to cut him off. \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, //please// stop trying to justify yourself.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor. I\u2019m sorry, doctor.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I asked \u2018what were you //thinking?!//\u2019, that was rhetorical.

I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry!\u201d His voice went up into a squeak, and tears were streaming down his cheeks.\n\n\n\nShe sighed, and held out a box of tissues. His eyes widened in horror, and she suddenly realized what else he might have intended using a box of tissues for. She winced.\n\n\n\n\u201c//Blow your nose,//\u201d she said flatly. \u201cWipe your face.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d He blushed again, but took the tissues from her.\n\n\n\nGruber drummed her fingers on her desk impatiently, watching as the guard cleaned himself up. \u201cAre you always this emotionally fragile?\u201d she asked him.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, I mean\u2026 not in a crisis situation. If the site was on fire, or if some monster had gotten loose, I\u2019d be totally calm.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI want you to understand that the only reason you are not in worse trouble is that you recognized this as a change in the anomaly, and reported it immediately.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. Thank you, ma\u2019am. Sir.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou //are// still in trouble, though.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 yes, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, relax. You\u2019re not fired.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe guard sat up straight.\n\n\n\n\u201cFirst offense,\u201d Gruber went on. \u201cReport to Nancy McDougall in HR tomorrow afternoon. Your pay will be docked for\u2026 probably a year, you\u2019ll have to take some training courses, you might be reassigned to a different site.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. Thank you, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\n\nGruber paused as a thought struck her.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis //is// your first offense, right?\u201d\n\n\n\nShe hadn\u2019t thought it was possible for the guard to blush any harder. \u201cWell, uh, last year, my girlfriend, my ex-girlfriend, I guess, she would, uh, call me while I was, uh, on duty, and we would, uh \u2013\u201d\n\n\n\nGruber held up a hand.\n\n\n\n\u201cI //meant//, have you used the SCP before.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh! No, never.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe indicated the CD-ROM sitting in its plastic case on her desk. \u201cHow did you even find out about it?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe guard shrugged. \u201cThere were rumors? I mean\u2026 people talk. Especially about things like this.\u201d\n\n\n\nGruber slumped. \u201cYou never heard of infosec?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, but\u2026 we all have clearance, right?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter you\u2019ve been to HR, you need to have a long talk with the people at RAISA.\u201d\t\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nDr. Mancini knocked at the open door to Gruber\u2019s office. \u201cGood afternoon, Vera. You wanted to see me?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, Pasquale. Come in. Before I explain what this is about, I need to tell you that I am //not// propositioning you. This is not any kind of flirtation.\u201d\n\n\n\nMancini\u2019s eyebrows went up. \u201cI would hope not,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure my husband would be very upset.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLast night, a guard reported a substantial change to a contained artifact. I had a quick glance afterward \u2013 enough to confirm that he wasn\u2019t just making shit up. But I think\u2026 I think it needs to have more than one person look into it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd you thought I\u2019d perceive that as //flirting?//\u201d\n\n\n\nGruber gave a thin smile. \u201cIt\u2019s [[[SCP-1004]]], so I figured I\u2019d be on the safe side.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOne zero zero four. Hm. Not ringing a bell\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nMancini pulled his tablet out of his pocket and tapped rapidly on the screen, then read the first few paragraphs of the results. \u201cUh\u2026 wow.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, \u2018wow\u2019 is right.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy did he even have it out of its containment locker?\u201d\n\n\n\nGruber looked at him. \u201cWhy do you think?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\t\n\n\u201cAh. Right. Where is he now? Fired?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, I sent him to talk to HR. He did report the change to me immediately, and I suppose there are worse ways he could have abused artifacts. Poor dumbass was mortified. He actually started crying.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re too nice. Wait, holy shit, someone actually suggested we use 1004 to //blackmail// people?!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYep. Assuming we could record its output, anyway. Which we can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\nMancini shook his head. \u201cWhat kind of idiot would actually write that down in a formal document with their name attached to it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I wondered about that. You\u2019ll never guess who it was.\u201d\n\n\n\nMancini looked puzzled. \u201cShould I know?\u201d\n\n\n\nAt her desk, Gruber clicked the option to show the document\u2019s history. \u201cAdam Dale,\u201d she said, indicating the screen.\n\n\n\nMancini blinked. \u201cAs in, Incident 1004-Dale? //That// Adam Dale?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYep. His fingerprints are all over this. All over the document, I mean. The actual artifact looks\u2026 reasonably clean.\u201d\n\n\n\nMancini raised his index finger. \u201cY\u2019know \u2013\u201d\n\n\n\nGruber cut him off. \u201cWhatever joke you were about to make, assume I\u2019ve already thought of it and decided it was disgusting, okay?\u201d\n\n\n\nMancini sighed and nodded. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the change?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cApparently, it used to be just a command prompt.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2018What would you like to see\u2019, right. But now?\u201d\n\n\n\nInstead of answering, Gruber pressed the button to open her desktop\u2019s CD drive, and inserted the disk. A window popped up on the screen, with one file in it.\n\n\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d she asked.\n\n\n\nMancini leaned on the desk so he could get a better view.\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, go ahead.\u201d\n\n\n\nGruber moused over the icon for TheFactory.exe, and double-clicked on it.\n\n\n\nThe screen went blank, then filled with a rendering of the Factory\u2019s logo in ASCII art. It slowly faded away, and a text box appeared.\n\n\n\n> {{**//THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING TO USE FACTORY P.O.R.N., THE PORNOMANTIC OMNIVERSAL RETRIEVAL NEXUS, DESPITE THE INTRODUCTION OF GENERATIVE A.I.

Just to see what kind of stuff people were looking for. It is some serious nightmare shit.\u201d\n\n\n\nMancini raised an eyebrow.\n\n\n\n\"Hold on, I\u2019ll give you access.\u201d Gruber typed a few commands on her keyboard, and Mancini tapped the fresh link that appeared on his tablet.\n\n\n\nHis gaze flickered across the screen. \u201cThis seems\u2026 pretty abstract?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, starting on page 8.\u201d\n\n\n\nMancini scrolled down to page 8. His face paled. \u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he whispered.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be bad enough if it was just generating them. If someone out there in the multiverse actually made these videos, for real?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat kind of sick bastard would ask for \u2013 oh shit, don\u2019t tell me it was \u2013\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAdam //fucking// Dale,\u201d Gruber said. \u201cYep.\u201d\n\n\n\nMancini scrolled down, and down, and down. \u201cThere\u2019s //nine hundred and eighty-five pages// of this?!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI say again: Adam //fucking// Dale.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMancini turned off his tablet, put it in his pocket, closed his eyes, and took a deep breath. \u201cPurely out of idle curiosity,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere is Researcher Adam Dale working these days?\u201d\n\n\n\nGruber smirked. \u201cI wondered about that too. Expected I\u2019d have access to his personnel file, but it\u2019s sealed until 59 years from now.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d Mancini said. \u201cThat means he\u2019s dead, right?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t confirm or deny that,\u201d Gruber said, nodding.\n\n\n\nMancini sighed. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat else is there?\u201d\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n> {{**Update:** Make sure to take regular breaks from using Factory P.O.R.N., so as to avoid chafing, which can lead to blisters and skin infections!

Other than a mention of pandemic safety protocols from 2020, there was nothing.\n\n\n\nGruber frowned. \u201cHmm.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking\u2026 they don\u2019t mention the cognitohazard.\u201d\n\n\n\nMancini scratched his head. \u201cDoes anybody use that word besides us?\u201d\n\n\n\nGruber made an impatient gesture. \u201cNot my point. This thing\u2019s been around for \u2013 how old is PayPal?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cUh, from the mid nineties, I think? I could look it up?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t bother. This thing\u2019s older than PayPal, is my point. And our file says that the threshold for turning into a sex monster is around a hundred hours of use.\u201d\n\n\n\nMancini nodded slowly. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re the sort of person who joins the official forums for it, you\u2019re probably a heavy user.\u201d He checked his tablet again. \u201cSays a hundred hours //straight//, but\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, no, I don\u2019t believe that either. Let me check something.\u201d She typed rapidly on her keyboard; the window with TheFactory.exe was replaced with the Foundation\u2019s standard UI, and she opened the directory of test logs.\n\n\n\nThey both swore.\n\n\n\n\u201cFuck. Look at those timestamps,\u201d Mancini said. \u201cNone of these tests lasted more than four hours.\u201d\n\n\n\nGruber\u2019s eyes were wide. \u201c\u2026 Did we accept that this was a cognitohazard just because Adam Dale said it was?!?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLooks like. But\u2026 wait, if he was that bad all along, why did the O5s go along with it?\u201d\n\n\n\nShe gazed at him for a long moment. \u201cPasquale, are you really asking why an organization would say that one of their people was the victim of psychic contamination by an anomaly instead of admit that they\u2019d let a sex monster hold a position of authority for over six years?\u201d\n\n\n\nHe bit his lip. \u201cWell, when you put it //that// way\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nShe closed her eyes and stretched her arms above her head, and cracked her knuckles. \u201cYou know what the real shame of it is?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLook at the dates on the access log. We\u2019ve had this thing in custody for almost thirty years, and that guard was the first one to touch it in almost //twenty// years, because we were all too scared of a bullshit cognitohazard that a sex monster made up to protect his own reputation. Think what we could have learned if we\u2019d gone on their forums and //talked// to people.\u201d\n\n\n\nMancini shook his head. \u201cYou think we would\u2019ve realized they even //had// forums?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI dunno. They obviously upgraded their UI a few times\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLost opportunities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMm.\u201d Gruber shook her head. \u201cWell, we do still have the program, and the FAQ does give us some hints that could be useful in actual research\u2026 I guess I\u2019ll update the containment file.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, fine.\u201d Mancini sat down in the office chair and slumped backwards, looking up at the ceiling. He grumbled.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Gruber asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 we spend all this time and effort researching the anomalies, trying to figure out what the hell is going on, and\u2026 it just bothers me that now we have one that comes with a detailed explanation of how it works, and the first step is \u2018it\u2019s literally magic\u2019.\u201d\n", "references": ["scp-1004"], "tags": ["tale"], "title": "Obsolescence - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/obsolescence", "year": 2025}, "of-starfish": {"created_at": "2025-01-02T16:32:00", "creator": "xexnoncores", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "xexnoncores", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/xexnoncores", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-02T16:32:00"}, {"author": "xexnoncores", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/xexnoncores", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-02T16:33:00"}, {"author": "xexnoncores", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/xexnoncores", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-02T16:34:00"}, {"author": "xexnoncores", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/xexnoncores", "comment": "Added tags: historical, orcadia, poetry, tale.

Uncertain translation and meaning, word seems to be compounded unusually from \u201clife\u201d, \u201csea\u201d and \u201cwater\u201d in the original text. Possible precursor to modern portmanteaus as seen in English and other Germanic descended languages.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-3\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-3')\">3</a>. Oral traditions throughout Finnfolk history have superstitiously assigned reproductive importance to only a single arm of most starfish species, even though, in actuality, they reproduce with all of them.

Five pearls as a cultural symbol seems to be present in most time periods of Finnfolk civilization.

Fivefold repetition here and in other tercets of this poem suggest intentional anaphora instead of an accidental clustering of words, marking this poetic device as the earliest developed by pre-Mitheric Finnfolk, at least according to records known by the Foundation.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-6\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-6')\">6</a>. Most likely a precursor to the modern Finnfolk phrase \u201cof rocks, like starfish\u201d, roughly translating in meaning to \u201cthese two objects are closely related to each other in some manner, usually by virtue of physical characteristics\u201d, similar to the English idiom \u201clike father, like son\u201d. It is currently unknown why this connotation developed; the most likely explanation is the hard, calcified remains of dead starfish being likened to stones.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-7\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-7')\">7</a>. Uncertain translation. Literal translation is \u201clife carvings\u201d\u2014\u201ccarvings\u201d was translated to \u201cnames\u201d due to context clues and greater poetic impact.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-8\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-8')\">8</a>.

It is theorized to have been created before the First Sealing War[[footnote]]Taking place from 3100 BCE to 3000 BCE.[[/footnote]], with thaumic-dating placing its origins at around roughly 6100-5900 BCE. Most likely to be part of a poem, it is one of the oldest examples of Finnfolk language and culture before its shaping by Mitheric influences into the forms we know today. \n\n\n\nIf you are reading this and not familiar with typical lens of historical poetic analysis, it is advised to first contact Dr. Molly Hussie at Site-212A to check on the date of available workshops, then to read this poem once without footnotes, and again with them for the best experience.\n\n\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[div class=\"scenesetter\"]]\n\n[[span style=\"color: blue; font-family: Grenze Gotisch ; font-size: 1.25rem\"]]Count their arms: I shall give blessings for each\n\n\n\nOne stroke of my scales\n\n\n\nTwo liftings out of the life-water [[footnote]]Uncertain translation and meaning, word seems to be compounded unusually from \u201clife\u201d, \u201csea\u201d and \u201cwater\u201d in the original text.

href=\"http://www.scpwiki.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43\">Site-43</a>: Lambton County, Ontario, Canada</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>Dr. Nhung Ngo sat at her desk, eyeing her schedule. Though it mostly consisted of the usual suspects, today would be the first time she was going to meet a new patient, one that was causing her usually calm demeanor to falter. She had met anomalies, she had met immortal beings, she had met children.</p>\n<p>But she had never met a <a href=\"/scp-8726\">permanently 6-year-old immortal</a>.</p>\n<p>James Everwood-Reynders, the adopted son of Site-43's new resident GoI Specialist and Acroamatic Abatement Chair, was due for his bi-yearly checkup; his first since coming to Site-43 from Site-55 down in Boston. Ngo knew that he had been born from the D-Class Parenthood Program, one of probably the most messed up things she had ever heard the Foundation was actively doing. And that included whatever the hell was going on in 17.</p>\n<p>She had read his file; Ngo knew that Dr. Everwood had fought to ensure he was treated like a peer after he was brought onto their team to assist in Dr. Wondertainment research, but had somehow wound up adopting him somewhere along the way. Site-55 was a weird place, but as weird as it was, Site-43 was even weirder still. Due to it's weirdness and resident immortal/James' adopted mother Dr. Ilse Reynders, this seemed like a good place to raise him. <em>Better than 17</em>, Ngo thought.</p>\n<p>A knock at the door.</p>\n<p>\"Come in,\" she said, putting on a warm smile.</p>\n<p>The door opened to reveal a person wearing a sweater with only one sleeve full and a little boy holding a Nintendo Switch, wearing a poofy jacket and knitted cap.</p>\n<p>\"Hello, Dr. Ngo. I hope you don't mind we're early.\" Jay Everwood smiled at Ngo, their hand on the boy's left shoulder. \"James, <em>como se dice?</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"Hi.\" James didn't look up from his Switch.</p>\n<p>\"No worries at all, Jay. How is Dr. Reynders?\" She got up from her desk, picking up a clipboard.</p>\n<p>\"Ilse is well. She's still obsessed with Gushers; to the point where James here can barely sneak one packet whenever we buy a box. But high fructose corn syrup aside, they are doing okay.\" Everwood laughed.</p>\n<p>\"That's great to hear. Maybe not the high fructose corn syrup bit, but I'm glad she's enjoying life. Come in, come in.\"</p>\n<p>Everwood and James entered the office, and his adoptive parent held out their hand to him, signaling to hand over the toy. James grumbled but obliged, putting his Switch into sleep mode and letting them take it.</p>\n<p>\"You'll get it back when you're done with Dr. Ngo, okay?\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay\u2026\" He pouted.</p>\n<p>\"Come on, sit on the couch and listen to what she has to say, and make sure to answer her questions. Be good. Love you.\" Everwood leaned down and kissed the top of James' head. The boy hopped up onto Ngo's couch while the psychologist sat across from him in a comfy arm chair.</p>\n<p>\"See you in an hour, Jay.\" Ngo grinned as they waved a goodbye to her, shutting the door behind them.</p>\n<p>The boy seemed standoffish. He was not making eye contact, instead opting to stare at his shoes. She cleared her throat and reached behind her ear for a pen to start taking notes.</p>\n<p>\"Hello, James. My name is Dr. Ngo.\"</p>\n<p>No response came.</p>\n<p>\"Your parent tells me you're a very sweet kid. What do you think?\"</p>\n<p>No response once more.</p>\n<p>\"Are you shy?\"</p>\n<p>He nodded, but did not look up.</p>\n<p>\"Well, that's okay. I am a stranger, after all, but I'm a friend of your parents and I'm here to help you assimilate into Site-43.\"</p>\n<p>\"What does ass\u2026 assimini\u2026 assimilate mean?\" James looked up but appeared to be staring through her.</p>\n<p>\"It means to make yourself at home.\" Ngo smiled reassuringly.</p>\n<p>\"My old home was Site-55. I used to play with Rex, May, and Chidi. They were my parent's em\u2026employees.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wow, you're using big words, James. I'm sure both your parents are proud of you.\" Ngo said, looking down on her clipboard and taking notes.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know my real parents,\" he said plainly, eyes shifting back down to his shoes.</p>\n<p>Ngo wrote this down before continuing. \"Does that bother you, James?\"</p>\n<p>\"Why?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, most people know their parents. Though based on your file, I know you are not exactly a normal kid.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm an ess-see-pee. Ess-see-pee-8726. My mom and dad were from Site-17, but I spent a long time with Dr. Everwood in Site-55 with Rex, May, and Chidi. But now Dr. Reynders is my mom and Dr. Everwood is my parent.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's right.\" Ngo blinked. How much had they told him about his nature? Surely telling a kid this much, especially one that was also an anomaly was against some sort of ethics code. \"Who told you all of this, James?\"</p>\n<p>\"The people I was with before Dr. Everwood,\" he stated innocently. Ngo sighed and flipped through her clipboard's attached SCP-8726 file, taking note of the fact that James had indeed originally come from Site-17.</p>\n<p><em>What a terrible place,</em> she thought. \"Well, James, we at Site-43 do things differently.\"</p>\n<p>\"I know.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes. We live in a house and not underground like everyone else.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's true. You're very smart, James.\" Ngo looked over at him, noticing he was biting his fingernails.</p>\n<p>No response.</p>\n<p>\"Is something bothering you?\"</p>\n<p>He nodded.</p>\n<p>\"What is it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Why is your name Dr. No?\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't understand.\"</p>\n<p>\"Your name is Dr. No. Why aren't you Dr. Yes?\"</p>\n<p>Ngo was taken aback momentarily, but laughed at his question.</p>\n<p>\"My name is Dr. Ngo. N-G-O.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's a weird name.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's not a very nice thing to say, James.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sorry\u2026\" The boy shrunk away, somehow managing to avoid eye contact even harder.</p>\n<p>\"It's okay, you didn't know. But now you do. It's a Vietnamese name. My parents are from Vietnam.\"</p>\n<p>\"What is Vietnam?\" He looked up quizzically.</p>\n<p>\"A country in east Asia. Would you like for me to show you it?\"</p>\n<p>His eyes lit up. Ngo smiled and produced her phone from within her pocket. She unlocked it and looked up information on the country, then moved to sit behind James. Maps, images of landscapes, water puppet theater, \u00d0\u00f4ng H\u1ed3 paintings, the former imperial city of Hu\u1ebf, \u00c1o d\u00e0i, the H\u00f9ng Kings' Festival, and images of Hanoi; time continued to creep forward, and Ngo and James only became more invested in their little exchange. Eventually, he was resting his head on her shoulder as they continued to talk.</p>\n<p>After some time of sharing her culture with James, she decided it was time to get back on track. \"Very cool, right?\" she asked, locking her phone and putting it away.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah! I liked the dragons.\"</p>\n<p>\"Me too! But James, I wanted to talk to you about how you were feeling about being here.\" Ngo retreated to her armchair, leaving James behind on the couch. He seemed disappointed, but willing to accept that the cool part of meeting her was over.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"You can tell me. It's my job to listen.\"</p>\n<p>James covered his face with his hands, a gesture Ngo found endearing.</p>\n<p>\"Everything you tell me is also confidential. That means I don't have to tell your parents,\" she said, taking note of his behavior on her clipboard.</p>\n<p>\"Really?\" he asked, moving a finger out of the way of his left eye to peek out.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, really. Anything you want to tell me, I can't tell them.\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026. I miss the kids I used to play with.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see. Being around someone your age can be a good way to stay enriched. But James, there are difficulties in that because\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't get old.\" His hands left his face, which was now formed into a slight pout.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026 Yes.\" Ngo sighed. \"But I know of a few people who also don't get old.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mom doesn't get old.\"</p>\n<p>\"Besides her. They're all grown-ups though, so I don't know how you would get along with them.\" Her voice trailed off a bit at the end of the sentence.</p>\n<p>\"It's okay. I know how to talk to grown-ups. Even if they like to boss me around.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm not here to boss you around, James.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're nice to me. But I know you're just a grown-up doing a job.\"</p>\n<p>Ngo paused, taken aback by the kid's bluntness. Though he hadn't strictly said as much, he had just effectively told her to take a hike for trying to psychoanalyze him.</p>\n<p>\"That's right. And right now, my job is to make sure you're doing okay. So tell me, are you doing okay, James?\"</p>\n<p>\"No.\"</p>\n<p>Again with the bluntness. There was a brief silence, accentuated by Ngo writing notes on her clipboard.</p>\n<p>\"Sorry to hear that. What else is bothering you?\"</p>\n<p>Silence. James fidgeted in his seat.</p>\n<p>\"Would you like some paper and colors to help you get your feelings out?\"</p>\n<p>He nodded vigorously, watching as the woman then stood to fetch some copy papers from her desk, alongside a pack of crayons she had bought in anticipation of his appointment. She handed them to James, who eagerly took them and started drawing on the floor of her office.</p>\n<p>\"What are you drawing there, James?\"</p>\n<p>\"It's a secret.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay. So now that you're drawing, do you want to tell me what else is on your mind?\"</p>\n<p>\"Mom keeps eating the Gushers. My parent says that she's just excited to have new food after something that happened to her, but they won't tell me what.\"</p>\n<p>\"Your mom\u2026 she had something bad happen to her. Something to do with\u2026 actually, I don't think they want to tell you what happened to her yet.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why?\"</p>\n<p>\"Why what?\" Ngo asked.</p>\n<p>\"Why don't they want to tell me?\"</p>\n<p>\"Because it's a lot for a kid like you to take in.\"</p>\n<p>\"But I want to know.\"</p>\n<p>\"We can ask your parent when they come to get you, how does that sound?\"</p>\n<p>James hesitated for a moment but eventually nodded.</p>\n<p>\"Okay. Good. Now, James, I want you to tell me about how you feel about your time in Site-17\u2026\"</p>\n\n<p>A knock at the door. It was Everwood, holding James' Switch. James got up and ran towards them, hugging their leg.</p>\n<p>\"Hey, Dr. Ngo. How was it?\" they grinned.</p>\n<p>\"As far as psychotherapy sessions go, not very fruitful, but I'm glad to report that we have established a degree of rapport. His next session will likely be much better.\" Ngo watched as James took back his Switch and activated it again, sounds of a Pokemon battle becoming audible.</p>\n<p>\"Well, that's good. I wanted to ask, can we bring him back again next week?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh? Sure. Any particular reason?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm worried that moving him to a new environment might be impacting him negatively. That and it's hard for him to make friends his age since, you know. Oh and, there's my inevitable mortality.\" Everwood's volume reduced as they spoke, but James still picked up on it.</p>\n<p>\"What does mortality mean?\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't worry about it yet, kiddo.\" they fussed his hair, and he returned his focus to his game.</p>\n<p>Ngo nodded. \"I understand. It would be my pleasure to see him next week. What do you say, James? Are you looking forward to seeing me in a few days?\"</p>\n<p>He didn't respond; too enraptured by the Venonat he was battling. Everwood nudged him. \"James.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, Dr. Ngo,\" he replied, looking up at her with a smile.</p>\n<p>\"Alright. We'll see you around, Nhung. Thank you.\" Everwood waved and turned with James in tow. Ngo followed them out into the hallway, arms folded and smiling as the two walked away. James looked up from his game to Everwood and tugged at their empty sleeve.</p>\n<p>\"What happened to mom?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>Ngo blanked, she had forgotten. Everwood turned to look back at her. They made brief eye contact, during which Everwood was able to discern that Ngo hadn't fully told him, but may have let some details slip. Everwood sighed and turned to James, who was looking up at them.</p>\n<p>\"What do you mean?\" they asked, hoping it was a misunderstanding.</p>\n<p>\"Dr. Ngo said that something bad happen to mom a long time ago. What happened to her?\"</p>\n<p>\"James, honey. This is a conversation we need to have with her present, okay?\"</p>\n<p>\"But I want to know!\"</p>\n<p>Everwood sighed, kneeling down to have their head at the same level as James'. They put their only hand on his right shoulder and took a deep breath.</p>\n<p>\"Your mom\u2026 she had an accident in the ADDC a long time ago.\"</p>\n<p>\"What's ADDC?\"</p>\n<p>\"Anomalous Document Disposal Chamber.\"</p>\n<p>He blinked in confusion. Everwood smiled and looked down for a moment, then back to him.</p>\n<p>\"It's where they got rid of weird books and things like that.\"</p>\n<p>James nodded.</p>\n<p>\"Anyway. She got stuck down there in 1943 and only got out a little less than four years ago.\"</p>\n<p>He started counting on his fingers before giving up at nine.</p>\n<p>Everwood laughed and Ngo grinned.</p>\n<p>\"Whatcha counting there, buddy?\" They asked.</p>\n<p>\"The years mom was in there.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're gonna run out of fingers mighty quick if you triy that.\" Everwood chuckled, fussing his hair. \"But anyway, we really should talk about this with your mom. So we'll do that when we get back to Grand Bend, okay?\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay.\"</p>\n<p>The one-armed doctor rose to their full height and looked over to the psychologist.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, Nhung.\"</p>\n<p>\"I didn't do anything. That young man is very emotionally mature for his age.\" She shrugged.</p>\n<p>\"I'm old for my age.\" James nonchalantly said, returning his attention to his game.</p>\n<p>\"Oh! Before you go, Jay. Look what James drew today.\" Ngo reached over to her desk and grabbed the paper the boy had been doodling on earlier. \"Isn't it lovely?\"</p>\n\n<div class=\"earthworm

Though it mostly consisted of the usual suspects, today would be the first time she was going to meet a new patient, one that was causing her usually calm demeanor to falter. She had met anomalies, she had met immortal beings, she had met children.\n\n\n\nBut she had never met a [[[scp-8726|permanently 6-year-old immortal]]].\n\n\n\nJames Everwood-Reynders, the adopted son of Site-43's new resident GoI Specialist and Acroamatic Abatement Chair, was due for his bi-yearly checkup; his first since coming to Site-43 from Site-55 down in Boston. Ngo knew that he had been born from the D-Class Parenthood Program, one of probably the most messed up things she had ever heard the Foundation was actively doing. And that included whatever the hell was going on in 17.\n\n\n\nShe had read his file; Ngo knew that Dr. Everwood had fought to ensure he was treated like a peer after he was brought onto their team to assist in Dr. Wondertainment research, but had somehow wound up adopting him somewhere along the way. Site-55 was a weird place, but as weird as it was, Site-43 was even weirder still. Due to it's weirdness and resident immortal/James' adopted mother Dr. Ilse Reynders, this seemed like a good place to raise him. //Better than 17//, Ngo thought.\n\n\n\nA knock at the door. \n\n\n\n\"Come in,\" she said, putting on a warm smile. \n\n\n\nThe door opened to reveal a person wearing a sweater with only one sleeve full and a little boy holding a Nintendo Switch, wearing a poofy jacket and knitted cap.\n\n\n\n\"Hello, Dr. Ngo. I hope you don't mind we're early.\" Jay Everwood smiled at Ngo, their hand on the boy's left shoulder. \"James, //como se dice?//\"\n\n\n\n\"Hi.\" James didn't look up from his Switch.\n\n\n\n\"No worries at all, Jay. How is Dr. Reynders?\" She got up from her desk, picking up a clipboard.\n\n\n\n\"Ilse is well. She's still obsessed with Gushers; to the point where James here can barely sneak one packet whenever we buy a box. But high fructose corn syrup aside, they are doing okay.\" Everwood laughed.\n\n\n\n\"That's great to hear. Maybe not the high fructose corn syrup bit, but I'm glad she's enjoying life. Come in, come in.\" \n\n\n\nEverwood and James entered the office, and his adoptive parent held out their hand to him, signaling to hand over the toy. James grumbled but obliged, putting his Switch into sleep mode and letting them take it.\n\n\n\n\"You'll get it back when you're done with Dr. Ngo, okay?\" \n\n\n\n\"Okay...\" He pouted.\n\n\n\n\"Come on, sit on the couch and listen to what she has to say, and make sure to answer her questions. Be good. Love you.\" Everwood leaned down and kissed the top of James' head. The boy hopped up onto Ngo's couch while the psychologist sat across from him in a comfy arm chair.\n\n\n\n\"See you in an hour, Jay.\" Ngo grinned as they waved a goodbye to her, shutting the door behind them.\n\n\n\nThe boy seemed standoffish. He was not making eye contact, instead opting to stare at his shoes. She cleared her throat and reached behind her ear for a pen to start taking notes.\n\n\n\n\"Hello, James. My name is Dr. Ngo.\"\n\n\n\nNo response came.\n\n\n\n\"Your parent tells me you're a very sweet kid. What do you think?\" \n\n\n\nNo response once more.\n\n\n\n\"Are you shy?\" \n\n\n\nHe nodded, but did not look up.\n\n\n\n\"Well, that's okay. I am a stranger, after all, but I'm a friend of your parents and I'm here to help you assimilate into Site-43.\"\n\n\n\n\"What does ass... assimini... assimilate mean?\" James looked up but appeared to be staring through her.\n\n\n\n\"It means to make yourself at home.\" Ngo smiled reassuringly.\n\n\n\n\"My old home was Site-55. I used to play with Rex, May, and Chidi. They were my parent's em...employees.\" \n\n\n\n\"Wow, you're using big words, James. I'm sure both your parents are proud of you.\" Ngo said, looking down on her clipboard and taking notes. \n\n\n\n\"I don't know my real parents,\" he said plainly, eyes shifting back down to his shoes.\n\n\n\nNgo wrote this down before continuing. \"Does that bother you, James?\"\n\n\n\n\"Why?\" \n\n\n\n\"Well, most people know their parents. Though based on your file, I know you are not exactly a normal kid.\" \n\n\n\n\"I'm an ess-see-pee. Ess-see-pee-8726. My mom and dad were from Site-17, but I spent a long time with Dr. Everwood in Site-55 with Rex, May, and Chidi. But now Dr. Reynders is my mom and Dr. Everwood is my parent.\" \n\n\n\n\"That's right.\" Ngo blinked. How much had they told him about his nature? Surely telling a kid this much, especially one that was also an anomaly was against some sort of ethics code. \"Who told you all of this, James?\"\n\n\n\n\"The people I was with before Dr. Everwood,\" he stated innocently. Ngo sighed and flipped through her clipboard's attached SCP-8726 file, taking note of the fact that James had indeed originally come from Site-17. \n\n\n\n//What a terrible place,// she thought. \"Well, James, we at Site-43 do things differently.\"\n\n\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes. We live in a house and not underground like everyone else.\" \n\n\n\n\"That's true. You're very smart, James.\" Ngo looked over at him, noticing he was biting his fingernails.\n\n\n\nNo response.\n\n\n\n\"Is something bothering you?\" \n\n\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\n\n\"Why is your name Dr. No?\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\n\n\"Your name is Dr. No. Why aren't you Dr. Yes?\"\n\n\n\nNgo was taken aback momentarily, but laughed at his question.\n\n\n\n\"My name is Dr. Ngo. N-G-O.\" \n\n\n\n\"That's a weird name.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's not a very nice thing to say, James.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sorry...\" The boy shrunk away, somehow managing to avoid eye contact even harder.\n\n\n\n\"It's okay, you didn't know. But now you do. It's a Vietnamese name. My parents are from Vietnam.\"\n\n\n\n\"What is Vietnam?\" He looked up quizzically. \n\n\n\n\"A country in east Asia. Would you like for me to show you it?\"\n\n\n\nHis eyes lit up. Ngo smiled and produced her phone from within her pocket. She unlocked it and looked up information on the country, then moved to sit behind James. Maps, images of landscapes, water puppet theater, \u00d0\u00f4ng H\u1ed3 paintings, the former imperial city of Hu\u1ebf, \u00c1o d\u00e0i, the H\u00f9ng Kings' Festival, and images of Hanoi; time continued to creep forward, and Ngo and James only became more invested in their little exchange. Eventually, he was resting his head on her shoulder as they continued to talk.\n\n\n\nAfter some time of sharing her culture with James, she decided it was time to get back on track. \"Very cool, right?\"\u00a0\u00a0she asked, locking her phone and putting it away.\n\n\n\n\"Yeah! I liked the dragons.\"\n\n\n\n\"Me too! But James, I wanted to talk to you about how you were feeling about being here.\" Ngo retreated to her armchair, leaving James behind on the couch. He seemed disappointed, but willing to accept that the cool part of meeting her was over.\n\n\n\n\"I don't know...\" \n\n\n\n\"You can tell me. It's my job to listen.\"\n\n\n\nJames covered his face with his hands, a gesture Ngo found endearing.\n\n\n\n\"Everything you tell me is also confidential. That means I don't have to tell your parents,\" she said, taking note of his behavior on her clipboard.\n\n\n\n\"Really?\" he asked, moving a finger out of the way of his left eye to peek out.\n\n\n\n\"Yes, really. Anything you want to tell me, I can't tell them.\" \n\n\n\n\".... I miss the kids I used to play with.\"\n\n\n\n\"I see. Being around someone your age can be a good way to stay enriched. But James, there are difficulties in that because--\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't get old.\" His hands left his face, which was now formed into a slight pout.\n\n\n\n\"... Yes.\" Ngo sighed. \"But I know of a few people who also don't get old.\"\n\n\n\n\"Mom doesn't get old.\"\n\n\n\n\"Besides her. They're all grown-ups though, so I don't know how you would get along with them.\" Her voice trailed off a bit at the end of the sentence.\n\n\n\n\"It's okay. I know how to talk to grown-ups. Even if they like to boss me around.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm not here to boss you around, James.\"\n\n\n\n\"You're nice to me. But I know you're just a grown-up doing a job.\"\n\n\n\nNgo paused, taken aback by the kid's bluntness. Though he hadn't strictly said as much, he had just effectively told her to take a hike for trying to psychoanalyze him. \n\n\n\n\"That's right. And right now, my job is to make sure you're doing okay. So tell me, are you doing okay, James?\"\n\n\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\n\nAgain with the bluntness. There was a brief silence, accentuated by Ngo writing notes on her clipboard. \n\n\n\n\"Sorry to hear that. What else is bothering you?\"\n\n\n\nSilence. James fidgeted in his seat.\n\n\n\n\"Would you like some paper and colors to help you get your feelings out?\"\n\n\n\nHe nodded vigorously, watching as the woman then stood to fetch some copy papers from her desk, alongside a pack of crayons she had bought in anticipation of his appointment. She handed them to James, who eagerly took them and started drawing on the floor of her office.\n\n\n\n\"What are you drawing there, James?\"\n\n\n\n\"It's a secret.\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay. So now that you're drawing, do you want to tell me what else is on your mind?\"\n\n\n\n\"Mom keeps eating the Gushers. My parent says that she's just excited to have new food after something that happened to her, but they won't tell me what.\"\n\n\n\n\"Your mom... she had something bad happen to her. Something to do with... actually, I don't think they want to tell you what happened to her yet.\"\n\n\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\n\n\"Why what?\" Ngo asked.\n\n\n\n\"Why don't they want to tell me?\"\n\n\n\n\"Because it's a lot for a kid like you to take in.\"\n\n\n\n\"But I want to know.\"\n\n\n\n\"We can ask your parent when they come to get you, how does that sound?\" \n\n\n\nJames hesitated for a moment but eventually nodded.\n\n\n\n\"Okay. Good. Now, James, I want you to tell me about how you feel about your time in Site-17...\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nA knock at the door. It was Everwood, holding James' Switch. James got up and ran towards them, hugging their leg.\n\n\n\n\"Hey, Dr. Ngo. How was it?\" they grinned. \n\n\n\n\"As far as psychotherapy sessions go, not very fruitful, but I'm glad to report that we have established a degree of rapport. His next session will likely be much better.\" Ngo watched as James took back his Switch and activated it again, sounds of a Pokemon battle becoming audible.\n\n\n\n\"Well, that's good. I wanted to ask, can we bring him back again next week?\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh? Sure. Any particular reason?\" \n\n\n\n\"I'm worried that moving him to a new environment might be impacting him negatively. That and it's hard for him to make friends his age since, you know. Oh and, there's my inevitable mortality.\"\u00a0\u00a0Everwood's volume reduced as they spoke, but James still picked up on it.\n\n\n\n\"What does mortality mean?\"\n\n\n\n\"Don't worry about it yet, kiddo.\" they fussed his hair, and he returned his focus to his game.\n\n\n\nNgo nodded. \"I understand. It would be my pleasure to see him next week. What do you say, James? Are you looking forward to seeing me in a few days?\"\n\n\n\nHe didn't respond; too enraptured by the Venonat he was battling. Everwood nudged him. \"James.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, Dr. Ngo,\" he replied, looking up at her with a smile.\n\n\n\n\"Alright. We'll see you around, Nhung. Thank you.\" Everwood waved and turned with James in tow. Ngo followed them out into the hallway, arms folded and smiling as the two walked away. James looked up from his game to Everwood and tugged at their empty sleeve.\n\n\n\n\"What happened to mom?\" he asked.\n\n\n\nNgo blanked, she had forgotten. Everwood turned to look back at her. They made brief eye contact, during which Everwood was able to discern that Ngo hadn't fully told him, but may have let some details slip. Everwood sighed and turned to James, who was looking up at them. \n\n\n\n\"What do you mean?\" they asked, hoping it was a misunderstanding.\n\n\n\n\"Dr. Ngo said that something bad happen to mom a long time ago. What happened to her?\"\n\n\n\n\"James, honey. This is a conversation we need to have with her present, okay?\" \n\n\n\n\"But I want to know!\"\n\n\n\nEverwood sighed, kneeling down to have their head at the same level as James'. They put their only hand on his right shoulder and took a deep breath.\n\n\n\n\"Your mom... she had an accident in the ADDC a long time ago.\"\n\n\n\n\"What's ADDC?\"\n\n\n\n\"Anomalous Document Disposal Chamber.\"\n\n\n\nHe blinked in confusion. Everwood smiled and looked down for a moment, then back to him.\n\n\n\n\"It's where they got rid of weird books and things like that.\"\n\n\n\nJames nodded.\n\n\n\n\"Anyway. She got stuck down there in 1943 and only got out a little less than four years ago.\"\n\n\n\nHe started counting on his fingers before giving up at nine.\n\n\n\nEverwood laughed and Ngo grinned.\n\n\n\n\"Whatcha counting there, buddy?\" They asked.\n\n\n\n\"The years mom was in there.\"\n\n\n\n\"You're gonna run out of fingers mighty quick if you triy that.\" Everwood chuckled, fussing his hair. \"But anyway, we really should talk about this with your mom. So we'll do that when we get back to Grand Bend, okay?\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay.\" \n\n\n\nThe one-armed doctor rose to their full height and looked over to the psychologist. \n\n\n\n\"Thank you, Nhung.\"\n\n\n\n\"I didn't do anything. That young man is very emotionally mature for his age.\" She shrugged.\n\n\n\n\"I'm old for my age.\" James nonchalantly said, returning his attention to his game.\n\n\n\n\"Oh! Before you go, Jay. Look what James drew today.\" Ngo reached over to her desk and grabbed the paper the boy had been doodling on earlier. \"Isn't it lovely?\"\n\n\n\n[[=image ngo.png]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:earthworm\">:scp-wiki:component:earthworm</a>\n\n| first=false | last=false| hub=yes\n\n| previous-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ | previous-title=The Pursuit Of Knowledge, And Other Frivolities\n\n| next-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ | next-title=The World Was Quiet Here\n\n| hub-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/on-guard-43-hub | hub-title=On Guard 43 Hub\n\n]]\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:wikimodule\">:scp-wiki:component:wikimodule</a> |normal= --]]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** ngo.png\n\n> **Author:** [[*user Agente Shuffle]]\n\n> **License:** CC BY SA 3.0\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-8726", "on-guard-43-hub", "scp-5231", "scp-3879", "scp-6467", "scp-6832", "scp-7260", "scp-5047", "scp-3085", "scp-4046", "scp-es-227", "scp-es-357", "scp-es-113", "scp-4206", "scp-3867", "scp-7337", "scp-2912-jp", "stormsite19", "zetetic-bulletin-wu-xing-iris", "just-another-day", "a-tale-about-petty-revenge", "wonder-world-dossier", "error-404-database-not-found", "daeva-cooking-and-you", "marw-el-reencarnado", "lillian-lillihammer-and-the-great-meme-war", "drunkenly-stumbling-down-memory-lane", "tim-wilson-s-close-shave", "the-good-ending", "life-insurance-policy", "the-remains-of-the-day", "nobody-likes-having-enemies", "ode-to-the-unknown-author", "uncle-nicolini-author-page", "sciptember-2022-art", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["art-exchange", "doctor-everwood", "on-guard-43", "researcher-james", "slice-of-life", "tale"], "title": "Pediatric Para-Psychology - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/pediatric-para-psychology", "year": 2025}, "potato-leek-soup": {"created_at": "2025-01-01T00:16:00", "creator": "VapidPoem", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "VapidPoem", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/vapidpoem", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-01T00:16:00"}, {"author": "Merehrab", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/merehrab", "comment": "SPaG fix", "date": "2025-01-01T01:55:00"}, {"author": "VapidPoem", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/vapidpoem", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-02T09:33:00"}, {"author": "VapidPoem", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/vapidpoem", "comment": "Added tags: bittersweet, lgbtq, slice-of-life, tale.

Then add in your salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Add in all of your chicken broth/stock. Increase the temp to bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and add your thyme and bay leaves. Let simmer for 15 minutes.</p>\n<p>After 15 minutes, try to pierce the potatos with a fork. If you can pierce them with no resistance, turn off the heat. Fish out the bay leaves, and mash the soup. After fully mashed, add the whole cup of cream to the soup and mix.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>- Clarke Family Recipe</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The familiar scent of cooked potatoes filled the whole kitchen, only being cut by the aroma of fried onions and garlic.</p>\n<p>Grabbing two towels, he picked up the Dutch oven and moved it to the dining room. His mother hurried around, grabbing a heat-safe placemat to set the Dutch oven on. Finally, a loaf of old, pre-sliced sourdough bread was brought to the table.</p>\n<p>And they began to eat.</p>\n<p>\"Andy?\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Yes?\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you want to do anything tonight?\"</p>\n<p>\"Like?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, I don't know. Watch a movie? Play a board game? Something. Anything, really.\"</p>\n<p>\"Maybe.\"</p>\n<p>\"Heh. That's not a no!\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah\u2026\"</p>\n<p>Their spoon is dipped into the soup. Andy eased the spoon into their mouth to taste it. <em>Hot. It is too hot.</em></p>\n<p>\"This is really good.\" He stated.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Same recipe as always?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, you caught me!\"</p>\n<p>She laughed.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\"Do you ever talk to your Aunt Shelly?\"</p>\n<p>\"Sometimes.\"</p>\n<p>\"How is she going along?\"</p>\n<p>\"Alright.\"</p>\n<p>\"When was the last time you two talked?\"</p>\n<p>\"A week ago.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah.\"</p>\n<p>A torn chunk of sourdough bread was dipped into the soup. He blew on it in a feeble attempt to cool it down before eating it.</p>\n<p>\"What about you?\"</p>\n<p>\"Hm?\"</p>\n<p>\"When was the last time you and her-\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh. A few weeks ago. Or a few months ago. You know?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah.\"</p>\n<p>Minutes passed until the soup was gone. <em>Tasty, as it had always been.</em> He used the remaining sourdough to soak up all of the remaining soup in his bowl.</p>\n<p>\"I can take that if you're done with it.\" She said, outstretching her hand.</p>\n<p>\"It's alright.\"</p>\n<p>\"You sure?\"</p>\n<p>\"I can get it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay, then.\"</p>\n<p>Plates and bowls clanked against each other as they were moved to the kitchen. When he was done, he emptied the Dutch oven into boxes of Tupperware and then into the fridge.</p>\n<p>The sink water rushed out of the faucet. He grabbed a sponge to vigorously scrub at the Dutch oven until every single speck of dirtiness was cleansed.</p>\n<p>Looking over at his mother, he saw her scrape chunks of food off of the plates into the trash can before they got crammed into the dishwasher.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><em>Tap. Tap. Tap.</em></p>\n<p>Footsteps rung as Andy Clarke ascended the staircase. He rested upon his bed as he finally entered his room. Andy allowed the warmth and heat of his body to be drained by the cool, soft bedsheets he rested on.</p>\n<p>And yet, a light shone directly on his eyes. A turn later, Andy glanced at his curtain.</p>\n<p><em>A curtain that had never quite actually fully closed.</em></p>\n<p>Several groans later, Andy rolled over on his side away from the light. He closed his eyes and tried to sleep. After twenty-three minutes, Andy's eyes opened.</p>\n<p>An urge overwhelmed him which drove him to grab his phone.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4 id=\"toc4\"><span>Mom</span></h4>\n<hr/></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>I found a nice place.

Andy took one sip and nearly spat it out. Not exactly a bad taste, but rather an extremely <em>off</em> one.</p>\n<p>A year spent living in Boulder, and this would be the first time that tap water tasted bad to him. He normally didn't mind unfiltered water. He <em>hadn't normally</em> minded it, at least.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Cold air rushed over him as he opened the fridge. Crisp, cool, calming air. An analysis of his fridge saw disappointment.</p>\n<p><em>Two containers of cold, buttered noodles,</em><br/>\n<em>Three eggs left in a carton,</em><br/>\n<em>And a bottle of rum.</em></p>\n<p>Not exactly a meal he envied for the fourth day in a row.

Think it would be useful to know and whatnot.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Well, um. Yeah! Sure. Let me find it really quick.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Horrid. It truly turned out as a horrid meal.</p>\n<p>Not when his mother made it, of course. But this was his first-ever attempt at even trying to cook. Ignore the noodles he boiled or the eggs he fried, this was a full-blown meal. His family's prized meal. A mean which he completely messed up.</p>\n<p>The pantry revealed next-to-nothing aside from salt, pepper, butter, and garlic powder. Luckily, the grocery store was around a five-minute walk away.</p>\n<p>Inside, he grabbed as much as he could remember as he hadn't bothered to write anything down.</p>\n<p><em>A cheap can of dried thyme,</em><br/>\n<em>A single, four-cup carton of chicken stock,</em><br/>\n<em>The first six potatoes he saw,</em><br/>\n<em>And a single head of garlic.</em></p>\n<p>His biggest pain was that he did not have or buy a vegetable peeler. Resorting to using a flimsy knife to cut off any skin or eyes, he chopped off at least a tenth of his total worth of potatoes.</p>\n<p>The potatoes were unwashed. Before, during, and after they were prepared. Dirt which clung to the potato's skin clung to the knife, which rubbed off on the clean interiors of the potatoes as they were cut. All with the flawed reasoning that he had convinced himself of being that the potatoes would be cleaned off in the bowl of water.</p>\n<p>While a rough chop was called for the leeks, they were given an impatient hacking-at by Andy. No care was given to ensure that the leeks were clean. Large chunks of soil and earth remained attached to the leeks as they were finished being prepared.</p>\n<p>At the very least, Andy didn't waste anything. He used <em>all</em> of the leeks. The roots, dried inedible leaves, and all.</p>\n<p>A realization dawned upon him at the last moment; he had no garlic crusher. Instead, he elected to use a mug to smash the garlic that was by some miracle peeled by him.</p>\n<p>Without a Dutch oven he was left no choice other than to use a simple, standard pot. The temperature was far, <em>far</em> too high. Garlic and leeks burned the second they touched the pot. Even as he smelled smoke, he let the aromatics burn for the whole three-minutes as the recipe described before he added potatoes. Thankfully, the potatoes still had some water with them and didn't burn.</p>\n<p>Whatever little chicken stock he bought was not enough. It failed to cover all of the potatoes without even being simmered down yet.</p>\n<p>A second forgotten memory came back. He had not purchased bay leaves at the store. Pushed to the back of his mind, he added in all of the spices. For all three seasonings he used, they all were produced at such a fast speed that he had to have poured in at least twice of the seasonings that the recipe called for.</p>\n<p>Unstirred, the boiling potatoes overflowed twice after he tried to cover them.</p>\n<p>The one thing Andy had remembered to purchase was a masher. He exerted nearly his full body weight on the masher to, unsuccessfully, grind the potatoes and leeks into chunks.</p>\n<p>After the fifteen minutes had passed, Andy turned off the heat and took the soup off of the burner.</p>\n<p>It was hot. It was salty. It was peppery. It tasted charred. At times it felt like he was drinking sand. He would find long strands of poorly-chopped leeks that got stuck in his teeth. It was a struggle to choke down his pathetic excuse of a soup. While he did, he opened his phone.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h3 id=\"toc8\"><span>Lauren</span></h3>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Heyyy.

Changing the temperature and whatnot to try to avoid burning it. Each stovetop might be different from another.\"</p>\n<p>\"What if I undercook it?\"</p>\n<p>\"It's a vegetarian soup. Not like it'll kill you.\"</p>\n<p>\"I guess.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't know. Not too much of a chef anymore. Just try to change the recipe until you find something that you like.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thanks.\"</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Three times.</p>\n<p>Andy thrice checked the shopping list. Seventeen days had passed since he had first tried making the soup. This time, he had prepared a list of the <em>right</em> amount of <em>all the ingredients</em> that he needed. This included all of the tools that he <em>should</em> need. Paramount being a new, $65 Dutch oven.</p>\n<p>With a new vegetable peeler, the skin was easily peeled off of all of the potatoes as he needed them. Roots severed and leeks bisected, Andy ran the leeks under cold water and meticulously washed out any semblance of dirt and filth before chopping them. He still came close to having accidentally severed his fingers three times.</p>\n<p>In unison, all of his preparation saw improvement.</p>\n<p>And even then, with all of his preparation and care, he still forgot the garlic crusher. Rather than use an old reliable mug, he elected to merely peel and chop the garlic. He reasoned that the bigger chunks would burn slower, anyways. Which was what it was about.</p>\n<p>The Dutch oven was placed on the stove at a medium-low heat, as Andy now wanted to carefully raise the temperature. Still-cold butter was allowed to melt in the Dutch oven. Just enough butter had been saved from making toast that morning for it. Andy would have to run to the store to get more butter for the rest of the week, later. Finally, in went the garlic and leeks. That was it - it would be important for him to get it right. A new factor Andy had learned was to frequently stir to disperse heat and prevent burning via movement.</p>\n<p>Nervousness overswept him. It didn't seem like there was enough fat in the Dutch oven. Maybe it was too wide? Maybe something else went wrong? Regardless as the seconds passed it became more and more likely to him that something was going to burn.</p>\n<p>Andy looked around his kitchen. He knew he was out of butter, with all that he had left being a bottle of olive oil. Without much time to think, he let a glug of olive oil into the Dutch oven. That was it. The pot began to sputter and hiss at him as the olive oil dispersed throughout it.</p>\n<p>Yet, it seemed to do the trick. The veggies weren't charred. When three minutes passed, he added in stock to deglaze the pan and ensure that any burned surfaces were completely destroyed.</p>\n<p>The rest of the cooking time was similar to his original attempt, albeit better executed. More stock, better chunks, and better mashing all contributed. He especially placed care on the seasonings he let into the soup in order to avoid another over-seasoned mess.</p>\n<p>When the soup was done, he turned off the burner and served it in a bowl. By this point, Andy knew that he had to wait for the soup to cool down. As he waited in anticipation, he made a call.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4 id=\"toc15\"><span>Mom</span></h4>\n<h5 id=\"toc16\"><span>Phone Call Record</span></h5>\n<hr/></div>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Hey Andy. What's up?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Not much. Just calling back to ask about the soup.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> What about it?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Just the recipe you sent me.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Yeah?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Are you sure you sent me the right recipe? Right ratios, cooking time, and whatnot?</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Um. Yeah? I'm pretty sure.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Huh.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Is something wrong with it?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yeah, no. It's just\u2026 I don't know.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Well, I can double-check it. It might just be something on your end; lack of experience or whatnot. I ought to've taught you how to make it when you were here.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yeah\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> But I guess that means that you should visit me sometime soon, huh?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yep. Soon.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> You got a plan figured out yet?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Not yet. But - could you just send me the recipe again? Double-check that it's the right one.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Of course.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I think it is the correct one. But it's just like\u2026 better to confirm it. You know?</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Yeah. I'll send it to you again.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Thanks.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Love you.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Love you.</p>\n</div>\n<p>He waited, waited, waited. A wait for the soup to finally cool down. Once the wait had passed, he sipped his first bite of the soup. It was a great improvement of the first, truly. Yet it still didn't taste quite <em>right\u2026</em></p>\n<p>Presentable, sure. If he had been able to eat the first soup, this would be easy. But it still just tasted off, for whatever reason.</p>\n<p>Before he knew it, the soup was gone. Immediately followed by him storing the soup in his fridge.</p>\n<p>And then came the dishes, utensils, and other implements that all sat around the kitchen. All of them, dirty.</p>\n<p>Andy pondered simply deciding to store them in the dishwasher, out of his sight and mind as they were roughly cleaned. Then he remembered his childhood, how often he pointed out dirt and residue on dishes only for his mother to dismiss him, claiming that he had OCD and was making a deal out of nothing.</p>\n<p>So he got to work. It took nearly an hour, but he did it. All of the dishes were scrubbed clean of their sin by the time he was done.</p>\n<p>His phone read <em>11:47 P.M.</em>. Which meant it was time for him to visit Quint and watch a movie.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Quint pressed a button on their remote. It activated the television. While the streaming service loaded, Quint looked through their fridge.</p>\n<p>\"You want anything?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nah.\"</p>\n<p>The fridge was then closed.</p>\n<p>\"I'm going to microwave some popcorn. You sure you don't want any?\"</p>\n<p>\"You know what? Fine.\"</p>\n<p>\"Heh.\"</p>\n<p>A single bag of popcorn was placed in the microwave. A few minutes passed before it was ready, at which point Quint tried to hand the bag to Andy.</p>\n<p>\"I'll wait.\"</p>\n<p>\"Really?\"</p>\n<p>\"It's only a few minutes.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay!\"</p>\n<p>When the second bag was ready, it was granted to Andy. He was joined by Quint as they jumped over the couch next to Andy.</p>\n<p>\"You ready?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yep.\"</p>\n<p>A button on the remote was clicked. The opening credits of <em>The Thing</em> played.</p>\n<p>At first, black completely filled the screen. Pure, empty black which was then broken by the opening credits of the movie. When the credits finished, fifty-seven stars littered the screen.</p>\n<p>One of the stars transformed into a spaceship that zoomed toward the camera and then to Earth. The spaceship landed in a cold, desolate land also known as Antartica.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>The film ended with a shot of a bright fire which had engulfed the entirety of the facility, one that would inevitably burn it to the ground.</p>\n<p>A facility, built long before, soon to be nothing.</p>\n<p>\"What a movie.\" Andy remarked.</p>\n<p>\"I know, right?\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't know why I didn't see it sooner.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's probably my favorite movie, honestly.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. I see why.\"</p>\n<p>Fixation overwhelmed him as the final seconds of the movie played. Specifically, he paid attention to just how bright the fire was. How it made a beacon which shone in an otherwise empty, dark, and baren landscape.</p>\n<p>\"Do you know what time it is?\"</p>\n<p>He checked his phone.</p>\n<p>\"One fifty-three A.M.\"</p>\n<p>\"Jesus.\"</p>\n<p>\"Kinda getting late.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah\u2026 You know. Only a <em>bit</em> late.\"</p>\n<p>\"I should probably start heading back. I need to fix up my sleep schedule.\"</p>\n<p>\"That is a good idea, yeah.\"</p>\n<p>The pair stood. Quint stretched as Andy checked his phone. While Quint stretched, they saw the back of their hand. Their nails adorned dark-purple nail polish.</p>\n<p>\"Hey Andy.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah?\"</p>\n<p>\"You ever had your nails done before?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nope.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you want to have your nails done? Should only be about ten minutes.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sure.</p>\n<p>A set of nail polish is retrieved and brought before Andy. The set is opened and several unique shades are presented.</p>\n<p>\"Alright. Pick a color.\"</p>\n<p>\"This one.\"</p>\n<p>\"Black?\"</p>\n<p>\"Is that alright?</p>\n<p>\"Of course.\"</p>\n<p>His hands eased while Quint guided them.</p>\n<p>\"Hold them steady. I don't want to get any polish on your skin.\"</p>\n<p>Over eleven minutes, Quint did Andy's nails. It took time for the polish to dry. But when it was dry, Andy held their new painted nails up in admiration.</p>\n<p>\"Wow.\"</p>\n<p>\"You like them?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah.

He was relaxed on his bed and typed on his phone. He barely elected to grant Andy a glance as Andy scurried by with their hand curled into a fist to ensure that their roommate didn't see their nails.</p>\n<p>In the kitchen, Andy checked his balance.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h3 id=\"toc17\"><span>Bank</span></h3>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p><strong>Aunt Shelley</strong> has sent you $275.00.</p>\n<p><em>To help you out with the first few weeks of food for college.

I don't know how much you have but I know college is rough. Especially nowadays.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yeah\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Shelley:</strong> I remember when I was going through it. Half of the time I was surviving on microwave meals and tv dinners. The other half I had nothing at all. I don't want you to go through that.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Well thank you.</p>\n<p><strong>Shelley:</strong> When are you starting college?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> In a week or two.</p>\n<p><strong>Shelley:</strong> Uh huh?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Mostly I've just been spending my time back getting ready for it. You know?</p>\n<p><strong>Shelley:</strong> Yeah. Well I better not get around wasting any more of your time.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> It's okay, we can still talk.</p>\n<p><strong>Shelley:</strong> No, no. I also probably have to get a head start on dinner soon.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Aww.</p>\n<p><strong>Shelley:</strong> I'll talk to you later, then.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> See ya.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The fridge door swung open, a single-serving container of the potato leek soup being taken from it. With the lid removed, it was set in the microwave to cook for four minutes.</p>\n<p>A reflection was visible on the microwave. While faint, Andy really had no choice but to stare into it as the minutes passed. That was until Andy raised their hand, taking a glance at their nail polish. Now, despite being a less-close look, they saw the imperfections in their nails. Minor nicks, scratches, and all sorts of blemishes dotted their nails.</p>\n<p>The faucet began pouring out water as they applied soap to their nails. There was a wait as the water began to heat. Nail polish on the edge of their nails where it met their skin curled. Andy picked at those curls in an attempt to peel off as much as they could.</p>\n<p>The water got hotter, and hotter, <em>and hotter.</em> Until it was so hot that they yanked it back in pain.</p>\n<p>Then the microwave beeped, cutting them off.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Cold. It was cold. The soup was cold. Not hot, not warm, not lukewarm, but cold. They would have put it back into the microwave to heat it further, except that merely feeling the soup seemed to overwhelm Andy with a sense of vertigo - making them sit down.</p>\n<p>A decision was reached to just eat the cold soup. Beside, Andy heard something about potato leek soup traditionally being served cold. Surely this would be good.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Abhorrent. An abhorrent, abnormally uninviting soup in stark contrast to the presentable soup the prior night.</p>\n<p>Still, Andy scarfed it down.</p>\n<p>When Andy had finished the soup, they walked to the sink and cleaned it. The soup seemed to easily wash away. At least, wash away much easier than their nail polish had. Andy looked at their nails one last time, noting how they looked similar to when they had awoken.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<hr/>\n<h3 id=\"toc20\"><span>Grocery List</span></h3>\n<hr/></div>\n<ul>\n<li>6x Potatoes</li>\n<li>1x Carton of Milk</li>\n<li>12x Cans of Soda</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>The cashier scanned Andy's select few items. The beeping of scanner and overall noise were drowned out by an abject nothing that flooded Andy's ears.</p>\n<p>\"That'll by $20.15.\"</p>\n<p>\"Huh?\"</p>\n<p>\"Your total.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, sorry.\"</p>\n<p>Their credit card was inserted into the reader.</p>\n<p>\"I like your nails.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Where'd you get the polish from?

Andy put all of the groceries they had bought into their fridge and cupboards.</p>\n<p>After the last grocery is put in the fridge, they take out the final portion of potato leek soup. Their roommate is nowhere to be seen, although Andy assumed they had eaten some of it.</p>\n<p>Six minutes. The soup spent six minutes in the microwave. By the time it was done, it was so hot that Andy needed oven gloves to remove it. They knew it would be a while before it cooled down to a point of edibility.</p>\n<p>Rather than wait, Andy opened their freezer and pulled out the ice cube tray. They popped out a single ice cube and dropped it in the soup, using their spoon to stir it around.</p>\n<p>When they took a sip, the soup was palatable. Better than being eaten cold and arguably better than the night it was cooked, but still just not quite there.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size:125%;\">Hello, Andy!</span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>You have started your shift at 16:58.</p>\n<p>Your shift is scheduled to end at 22:30.

They point at Andy's hand.</p>\n<p>\"Did you not like them?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, no. I did. I just woke up and they mostly had fallen off already.

They opened their laptop to pass later into the night.</p>\n<p>Throughout the night, Andy grew curious.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<blockquote>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<td>\ud83d\udd0d\ufe0e Search the web</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026..</p>\n<blockquote>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<td>\ud83d\udd0d\ufe0e Prettiest nail polish colors</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026..</p>\n<blockquote>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<td>\ud83d\udd0d\ufe0e Tutorial for applying nail polish at home</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026..</p>\n<blockquote>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<td>\ud83d\udd0d\ufe0e Where to buy nail polish in Boulder, Colorado</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Andy watched as an unfamiliar person left Quint's apartment and walked to a car. As they drove away, Andy moved to knock on Quint's door.</p>\n<p>\"Hey Andy.

That's my roommate. She's leaving to go to work.\"</p>\n<p>\"Uh huh?\"</p>\n<p>The hair atop Quint's head had been cut short in the three days since Andy and Quint last hung out.</p>\n<p>\"Nice cut.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thanks.\"</p>\n<p>\"You like it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. I've wanted to cut my hair short for a while. Takes less care.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm starting to grow mine out. Save money on getting haircuts.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh yeah?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. I head about Bob Ross doing that before he got a show.\"</p>\n<p>\"Is that why he had the afro?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. Although I did read something about how he ended up hating his hair.\"</p>\n<p>\"You ready?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yep.</p>\n<p>It took a minute, but Quint retrieved thirteen different shades of nail polish and brought them to the table in front of Andy.</p>\n<p>\"Pick one.\"</p>\n<p>\"Black is fine.\"</p>\n<p>\"Pick another.\"</p>\n<p>\"Dark blue?\"</p>\n<p>\"And another.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't know.

You're going to want to start with the nail base-\"</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Late at night, Andy laid in bed and watched videos on their phone. Video after video on Youtube of short, two-to-five-minute-long nail polish tutorials.</p>\n<p>A method they had been taught by their scrolling was finally fully functionally devised.</p>\n<p>Before Andy could enact it, they moved to their bathroom with nail polish. They tried as hard as they could to be quiet as they knew their roommate was asleep.</p>\n<p>A bottle of nail polish remover was opened, soon placed on Andy's nails in an effort to wear out the paint.</p>\n<p>One minute passed. Then two minutes. Then three minutes.</p>\n<p><em>Then five minutes.</em></p>\n<p>After exactly seven minutes a nozzle is turned and hot water begins to pour out of the faucet. Nail polish which touched Andy's skin had already began to peel and curl up. Andy grabbed the nail polish and meticulously peeled off as much as they could.</p>\n<p>Streaks and dots of nail polish once again littered their nails. Running their nails under the hot water did help, although specks of nail polish remained never-the-less.</p>\n<p>A short trip to the kitchen saw Andy grab a few sheets of paper towels before they retreated to their room.</p>\n<p>The paper towels were strewn on the table. Andy grabbed the dark purple nail polish, nail base, and coat.</p>\n<p>Nail base came first. It flowed along his nails, although admittedly a bit too much was applied.</p>\n<p>Then came the first layer of nail polish. Although inconsistent in its application, it generally avoided overlap onto their skin.</p>\n<p>Five minutes passed.</p>\n<p>Then came the second layer of nail polish. Now, it coated every atom of their nails and more. In several cases it fell onto their skin.</p>\n<p>Andy picked away at the excess nail polish with a nail file attached to their nail clipper to scrape off as much as they could. But still a thin layer solidified within seconds of it being applied, fusing to their skin.</p>\n<p>Five minutes passed.</p>\n<p>And the coat was applied over all of the polish.</p>\n<p>What Andy was left with was obvious. <em>A disaster.</em> Their nails were bumpy, the nail polish looked ugly, nail polish had gotten stuck under their nails. It was a fiasco.</p>\n<p>And yet, it hardly mattered. It was <em>theirs.</em> They had applied the nail polish on their own. Never mind the imperfections, Andy was left in admiration of their work.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>In the parking lot, Andy was left in panic. It was a quick trip, with them only needing to grab one item.</p>\n<p>But, their nails remained. Near-pristine. <em>As pristine as shoddily-applied nail polish could be.</em></p>\n<p>When they left their car their fingers were curled into a fist. It was enough for Andy to feel comfortable walking in public with markings on their nails.</p>\n<p>Twenty-seven seconds passed after Andy entered the store. They passed a clothing aisle. A previously fast pace slowed down as an outfit got caught in the corner of their eye.</p>\n<p>A mannequin adorning a long, brown pocketed skirt, a mini-belt, and a long-sleeved brown shirt.</p>\n<p>Their phone rang.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4 id=\"toc21\"><span>Mom</span></h4>\n<h5 id=\"toc22\"><span>Phone Call Record</span></h5>\n<hr/></div>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Andy!</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Hey.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Is now a good time to talk for a bit?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Not really.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Aww.

Is it doing you well?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yeah. I like it. It's been a lot less stressful than the dorms.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> I still think you're overplaying it a bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Come on.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> I mean - no use arguing it now. It's over with. But still.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> So, yeah\u2026 To be frank, I'm not sure that I like my roommate too much.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Really?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yeah. He's been eating all my food, not doing dishes. All that stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Well that's just what happens when you rent your own place. Stuff isn't so easy.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> And that wouldn't have happened in dorms?</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Really?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> What?</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> People had a lot more manners back when I was in the dorms. When I moved out-</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Hang on- I need to grab something real quick. I'll have to call you back later.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Well, hang on. Just another minute or two?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yeah\u2026 Sure.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> How's that soup coming along for ya? Did you have the right recipe?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yeah, I did.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Did it work out better the second time around?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yeah. Did end up tweaking the recipe around a bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> What?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yeah. I think my stovetop is wonky. Had to adjust the heat, add in a bit of olive oil.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Andy! You should have called me first.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I mean - I did. Just, right before I started cooking.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> You- \u2026 Andy, you know what I meant.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Oh? Sorry, then. Don't see how it was that big of a deal.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> What did you change with it? What was the whole recipe you used?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Um. Pretty much the same recipe? I just changed around the cooking time a little bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Okay. What was the whole recipe.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I don't remember-</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Well, there you go! That's cause you didn't follow a recipe. And now you're complaining about how it turned out bad.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Mom-</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> What?!</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I don't remember it off the top of my head!</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Do you have a copy of it?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Not right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Uh huh?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> All that I changed was the cooking time because I burned the garlic the first time.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Why?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> One of my friends suggested it.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Who?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> His name is Quint. They-</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> What was the greater context surrounding that?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I just brought it up.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> All do respect to Quint, whoever he is-</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Quint doesn't go-</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> -but this recipe has been in our family for generations and generations. All due respect to him, but I trust the family recipe more than him. You know?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yup\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Andy, here's my idea. I think you should try the recipe a few more times before you alter it to your own taste. That sound good?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I was kinda planning on that. Changing it around until I know exactly how to avoid mistakes and all.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> But, I want you to call me whenever you make it. No listening to friends or making up how to cook it on the fly. Instead I need you to let me in on everything you do. Okay?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Okay\u2026</p>\n</div>\n<p>Deep breaths. Deep, deep breaths.</p>\n<p>Breathing did not help.</p>\n<p>Andy tried to continue their search toward the store. They just needed an immersion blender for the soup. Nothing else.</p>\n<p>They found their legs becoming stiff, which did not help Andy as their pace nearly tripled. Sweat formed on their brow. It dripped down their forehead into their eye. Whatever control Andy had of their breathing vanished as Andy found themself unable to breath.</p>\n<p>Then Andy saw a unisex bathroom. Without a second thought, the door was opened then slammed behind them with nearly full force. The door was locked behind them.</p>\n<p>It took nineteen paces around the small, cramped room for Andy to finally breathe again.</p>\n<p>Now able to breathe, they sat on the toilet for five minutes. With a jolt, they rose to the mirror. Their eyes had gotten beet red, although no tears had formed.</p>\n<p>Their thumb and index finger moved to their sinus and pinched hard. A minute passed and Andy swallowed.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4 id=\"toc23\"><span>Mom</span></h4>\n<h5 id=\"toc24\"><span>Phone Call Record</span></h5>\n<hr/></div>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Yes?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I just wanted to say something else-</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> What is it?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I just wanted to talk a bit about the recipe - what I am thinking about it and whatnot.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Okay.

I can't do this.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I'm not going to yell at you.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> So what is it?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> It's just more- what I'm thinking is that I change the recipe a bit while I learn how to cook. Avoid burning things and everything like that.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> And that just applies to cooking temp?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Mostly. I'm also getting an immersion blender-</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Andy\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Because I don't like how chunky I cut the potatoes.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Andy! That's one of the biggest parts of the recipe! It's supposed to have chunks in it.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I don't\u2026 really agree with that. I just think-</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Sorry, but I don't think you're making the same soup anymore.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> It's just one thing-</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> It's two. The temp, now this. Next you're going to tell me something else, and then something else. It's not the same soup anymore, just admit that.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Mom! I-</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Stop. I told you that I can't argue right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Okay then! Sorry.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> So stop yelling at me, stop arguing with me, and be honest with me that it isn't just that.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> It was just the temp thing. The blending thing's only something that I might do.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Might?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I don't know. Just see if I like it more.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> I think you're changing your answers now; which I don't really like.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> That was always what I was going to do.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> I don't like it when you lie to me, sweetie.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I just-</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> You know what, Andy?

But that's not the same soup and it won't ever be. Unless you change it back, it's fundamentally different. And lets just leave it at that. Agreed?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yep.</p>\n<p><strong>Susan:</strong> I'm going to go. I have to take a shower. Love you.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Love you\u2026</p>\n</div>\n<p>The call ends.</p>\n<p>They let out a scream.</p>\n<p>A scream they hoped wasn't heard by anyone. Really, really hoped.</p>\n<p>It took another twenty-three paces to calm down. When they stopped, they looked in the mirror. The sight of their reflection overcame them with a need to cry.</p>\n<p>Their best effort to suppress their tears were in vain. It couldn't be held in forever. As he realized that truth, Andy let themself cry for only one minute.</p>\n<p>A paper towel was produced by the dispenser and used to soak up any water around Andy's eyes. Still, they were bloodshot. At best, Andy hoped that the cashier would think they were high.</p>\n<p>It took them a lot, but they managed to convince themself to leave the bathroom.</p>\n<p>There was no point in getting the immersion blender anymore. So they went to leave the store. Two employees looked at them, an act that confirmed they had heard Andy's scream.</p>\n<p>Right before they left, Andy's eye was caught once more. The outfit. On a discount, no less.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>$45.99</p>\n</div>\n<p>And it was silly. They didn't have that much to spare - couldn't afford any split-second purchases.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Except they could. It was priced the same as an immersion blender.</p>\n<p>Andy looked around for a price tag. Eventually, Andy found that it was priced at $45.99. Andy didn't know if they had that much to spare. Nor why they were even considering it.</p>\n<p>But, they had decided not to buy the immersion blender. They would, in all likelihood, be a similar price. Andy toiled and considered.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\"Will that be all for the day?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yep.\"</p>\n<p>\"Total should be around $45.99.\"</p>\n<p>The cashier was handed a credit card.</p>\n<p>\"It's for my sister.\"</p>\n<p>\"Uh huh?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. Her birthday is coming up. Wanted to get her something nice.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, she must be pretty lucky. It's a pretty nice dress.\"</p>\n<p>\"It really is.\"</p>\n<p>\"Would you like a receipt?\"</p>\n<p>\"No thank you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Have a great day.\"</p>\n<p>They knew.</p>\n<p>The cashier knew.</p>\n<p>Andy could see it in their eyes.</p>\n<p>Outfit in hands, they left the store as fast as they could, getting in their car and screaming.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4 id=\"toc25\"><span>Roommate</span></h4>\n<hr/></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>You going to be here tonight?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>No.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Where are you going to be at?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>A party.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Okay.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just curious.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Even though their roommate would be gone, Andy instinctively locked themself in their bathroom.</p>\n<p>They took off their jacket, then their belt, then their jeans, then their shirt, then their socks, and finally their boxers.</p>\n<p>And then they were nude. Completely.</p>\n<p>Immediately followed was a feeling of relief. Their clothes had been a bit tight on them.</p>\n<p>Andy glanced over at the door to confirm it was locked. With the final confirmation, Andy opened the bag.</p>\n<p>Three components.</p>\n<p>A skirt. A shirt. And a belt.</p>\n<p>It quickly dawned on them that they would need a bra and panties to comfortably complete the set.</p>\n<p><em>Complete the set?!</em></p>\n<p>They hardly knew why they bought the outfit in the first place. Yet, they put it on piece-by-piece-by-piece, followed by a glance in the mirror.</p>\n<p>And they were beautiful.</p>\n<p>Although not the perfect fit, the clothes were the most comfortable thing Andy had ever worn. It fit their shape well, the fabric was soft. Oh, it was soft.</p>\n<p>Andy began to cry. Not tears of stress, exhaustion. Rather tears of emotion, elation.</p>\n<p>Andy turns, and turns, and turns, and turns, and turns. They adore every angle, every aspect of their outfit.</p>\n<p>It takes five minutes before Andy seems to snap out of adoration.

It just had to.</p>\n<p>All of the soup they had made was inedible. It was disgusting, <em>repulsing</em> to eat.</p>\n<p>So much food went to waste all in a single moment. They went to their fridge to find some food, <em>any food.</em></p>\n<p>Before they could choose, they ran to the bathroom and vomitted.</p>\n<p>When they finished, they wiped the vomit off of their lip and went to their bedroom. Seeing a glass of water, they emptied it.</p>\n<p>And collapsed on their bed.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Tossed and turned, turned and tossed. They tossed around for twenty-seven minutes.</p>\n<p>All they wanted was to be able to close their eyes and rest. But, they couldn't.</p>\n<p>Andy shot up, sitting in their bed. They turned, their eyes locking almost like a magnet to the dress that laid on their bed.</p>\n<p>With a single motion, they grabbed the dress.

The belt was snapped, the sleeves ripped off the shirt before themself being halved.</p>\n<p>Massive holes were ripped through the shirt until it was nothing but a rag.</p>\n<p>Five minutes passed.

Despite just eating, they were hungry.</p>\n<p>The fridge door opened and the note they had left was gone. <em>As well as one of their energy drinks\u2026</em></p>\n<p>It was at that moment Andy decided to move out.</p>\n<p>They grabbed pre-cooked, cold spaghetti noodles out of the fridge. Rather than microwave them, Andy put grated parmesan on them and moved to their room with a fork to eat them cold.</p>\n<p>Not bothering to turn on a light, they sat in front of their laptop and quickly finished the pasta. A sigh left Andy's mouth as they looked at an essay they had to write.</p>\n<p>400 words done.</p>\n<p>3,000 words needed.</p>\n<p>A clock read <em>10:52 P.M.</em></p>\n<p>They had time, plenty of time. They just needed to write.</p>\n<p><em>11:55 P.M.</em></p>\n<p>500 words done.</p>\n<p>3,000 words needed.</p>\n<p>The laptop screen was left open as they moved to their bed. Curled up in a ball, facing away from the light, and they eventually saw a scrap.</p>\n<p>Despite being only a thousandth of the original's glory, it had all the pull. Both eyes locked on the shred as their hand outstretched to grab it.</p>\n<p>Andy let out a gentle laugh.</p>\n<p>\"Must've been poor quality- with how easy it was to tear\u2026\"</p>\n<p>They wrapped their body around a pillow, cooling off with shred still in hand.</p>\n<p>\"Wouldn't have lasted if I wore it more than once\u2026\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><em>Wore it where?</em></p>\n<p><em>In their room?</em></p>\n<p><em>In public?!</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>No no, they wouldn't have. It made sense for them to rip it; they didn't need it. They simply didn't.</p>\n<p>Yet Andy did not know why they were holding on to the last scrap of fabric so tightly.</p>\n<p><em>12:21\u00a0A.M.</em></p>\n<p>They went to their desk and shook their cursor around to turn on the screen.

An excuse why they didn't buy it. They couldn't drop 1/5th of their money on makeup! Not at the moment.</p>\n<p>And then Andy remembered how much cheaper it was to buy things in person vs online\u2026</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>The cashier didn't believe them. There was no way. Literally no way. It was like when Andy bought the dress.</p>\n<p>They claimed it to be for Christmas shopping, a gift for their mother. The cashier didn't buy it for a second. At the very least, they <em>suspected</em> it. Buying <em>all of that makeup</em> for one person who'd likely <em>already have it?!</em></p>\n<p>Andy only hoped.</p>\n<p>They locked the bathroom door behind them and dropped the bag on the counter. Their roommate was there, so they had to be careful.</p>\n<p>Andy started with the eyeliner - which was shakily applied. It curved and swayed as dots of skin peeked out throughout both of their upper eyelids.</p>\n<p>Next up - the blush. The kit came with four different colors. The initial blush that Andy applied hardly matched their skin tone. Andy grabbed a wet towel and tried to wipe off the blush. Yet, it persisted. After Andy's face was dried off, Andy tried to apply a different kind of blush. All that Andy was left with were patches of dust that clinged to their face that were either too red or too pale for their skin tone.</p>\n<p>Then; the lipstick. They went with the red lipstick. The lipstick overlapped from their lips to their skin until they were left with a bumpy, shoddily applied red coating their lips.</p>\n<p>The only thing that could save the day was the mascara. Their eyelashes were coated, and came off being longer. Much to Andy's shagrin, the mascara was hardly noticeable.</p>\n<p>Even with it being the best application, tiny dots of black which stemmed from the mascara hit their upper eyes.</p>\n<p>Andy looked into the mirror to see an object of horror. Although recognizable who was behind the mask, it was a hard sight.</p>\n<p>Yet, the tiniest twinge of pride overcame them. It was their first time trying and not all that bad. But they simply couldn't avoid how bad it looked at first.</p>\n<p>Andy heard their roommate walking throughout the house and sighed. They grabbed the towel and cleaned their face.</p>\n<p><em>Then nothing came off.</em></p>\n<p>The towel was soaked in water before being applied directly on their face. They panicked, scrubbing as hard as they could to get it off.</p>\n<p><em>It was water resistant. All of it was!</em></p>\n<p>They glanced into the mirror, seeing the makeup merely smudge on their face without coming off.</p>\n<p>Their roommate would certainly notice if they saw. They would notice, and they would <em>judge</em>. Especially for how bad the makeup was.</p>\n<p>Andy jumped into the shower and turned on the water. It was still freezing cold, and it remained freezing for the rest of the shower.</p>\n<p>When they finished, they dried off their face and looked into the mirror.</p>\n<p>Remnants of the makeup stayed, but they were more discrete. Much of their eyeliner and lipstick had washed off. All that remained was a hardly-noticeable shadow of the makeup they had just tried to apply.</p>\n<p>As the bathroom door unlocked, they saw their roommate.</p>\n<p>They were concise and told the roommate that they planned to move out soon.</p>\n<p>The roommate asked why.</p>\n<p>Andy told them why.</p>\n<p>The roommate asked what day.</p>\n<p>Andy said that they did not know.</p>\n<p>The roommate confirmed that Andy was leaving the house.</p>\n<p>And Andy affirmed them.</p>\n<p>Then the roommate wished them well, and thanked them for letting them know.</p>\n<p>And that was it. Andy walked into their room and picked up their phone.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4 id=\"toc34\"><span>Quint</span></h4>\n<hr/></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>I can move in with you if you're still looking for someone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>cool</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n\n</div>\n<p>Andy set down their phone.

The beer is handed to Quint, who shoves the six-pack into their backpack.</p>\n<p>The pair follow a trail into the woods just into the Rockies.</p>\n<p>After roughly seventeen minutes, the pair arrived at a clearing slightly off-trail. Quint took out a blanket to place on the grass while Andy kicked off their shoes and felt the blades of grass beneath their toes.</p>\n<p>Two bottles of beer were popped.</p>\n<p>\"Feels like forever since we've hung out, huh?\"</p>\n<p>\"It's been a while.\"</p>\n<p>\"Especially since we've gone out here.\"</p>\n<p>\"We should come out here more.

While Andy had moved to lay on the blanket, Quint decided to lay on the grass, at least briefly.</p>\n<p>The pair stared into the stars for thirty-one minutes all while sipping their beers.</p>\n<p>At a point during the night, Andy had grabbed a third beer. By the time they were back in the car, the bottle was empty. The bottle Quint had nursed was thrown away in a trash can they found, still half-full.</p>\n<p>As the pair entered the car, Quint turned on a light to search it.</p>\n<p>\"What are you looking for?\"</p>\n<p>\"My keys.\"</p>\n<p>\"You know- you\u2026 you probably shouldn't just leave those in the car\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Heh.

They helped Andy remove their shoes and tuck themselves under the sheets.</p>\n<p>\"I'm going to hang out here a minute- while I wait for a cab.\"</p>\n<p>\"No, no- no\u2026 Don't.

It had been thirty minutes since Andy had tried to start falling asleep. Their plane was set to leave next morning and they wanted any small amount of sleep.</p>\n<p>But their curtain was broken, as it had always been. Light shone directly on their face.</p>\n<p>Andy wondered what awaited them when they returned. After all, Quint was convinced of something that flat out wasn't true. Something that Andy was not.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Although the makeup was suspicious. Obviously Quint shouldn't of looked, but Andy\u2026</p>\n<p>\u2026stood up and tried to yank the curtain close. Doing so saw barely anything change as moonlight still flooded the room.</p>\n<p>They crawled back into bed then covered themself in sheets.</p>\n<p><em>What about their mother?</em> She had been in bad health for such a long time, Andy considered. They knew she wouldn't be around forever. If Andy ever wanted to tell her something that they'd regret not letting her know, they'd have to say it soon.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, <em>there was absolutely nothing that Andy needed to say.</em></p>\n<p>Aside from them starting to wear nail polish. Although they wouldn't really feel bad over not telling them that.</p>\n<p><em>But what about the mascara? They'd been wearing that almost every day before they left.</em></p>\n<p>And the <em>lipstick.</em></p>\n<p>And the <em>blush.</em></p>\n<p>And the <em>eyeliner.</em></p>\n<p>But they reasoned that they had only tried those things once and immediately washed them off.</p>\n<p><em>Only because their roommate was there. What if they were alone? Would they still have washed it off so quickly?</em></p>\n<p>Even then, they were all just minor things to Andy. Stylistic things that weren't exactly major secrets\u2026</p>\n<p>But-</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4 id=\"toc44\"><span><span style=\"color: cyan\">What</span> <span style=\"color: pink\">if</span> <span style=\"color: silver\">Quint</span> <span style=\"color: pink\">was</span> <span style=\"color: cyan\">right?</span></span></h4>\n</div>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>They stormed out of their bed to the curtain and grabbed both sides of it. Andy slammed together both curtains with such forced that the curtain rod was knocked off of the wall. It fell to the ground.</p>\n<p>They sighed and leaned to pick up the curtain. Before they put it back, Andy stared out the window.</p>\n<p>And then they opened it.</p>\n<p>They inhaled the cool, crisp air as it rushed past them. It wasn't too cold for a winter's night. They looked down at a field just a bit below them.</p>\n<p>With a second thought, Andy adorned a jacket and moved downstairs.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>They walked through the field. Snow crunched under each footstep. It took effort to avoid the tangled amalgamation of roots and dead plants while making their way through the field.</p>\n<p>But, they made it. A small clearing where they begun to breathe what felt like the freshest air they had in years. Only two sounds were heard, Andy's breaths and the gentle breeze of the wind.</p>\n<p>They looked up into the sky. Fifty-seven stars littered it. A burning fire that shone all the way across the universe just so Andy could glimpse it.</p>\n<p>They sat on the ground. Their coat was waterproof, allowing them to have some protection.</p>\n<p>Then they zoned out and enjoyed the cosmos. When they returned, they had no idea how much time they had lost.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>They were terrified. Terrified of the repercussions of it, of what it would mean if it were true.</p>\n<p>Their whole life - everything they have had up until a few months prior, wasn't what they were.</p>\n<p>And what if they did tell their mother? What if they were disowned? What if their mother spent the last few months of her life hating her-</p>\n<p>-hating them.</p>\n<p>They shiverred. It was cold. They knew it was time for them to go back.</p>\n<p>They stood, feeling that snow had gotten through their coat. Somehow.</p>\n<p>At the icy porch, Andy took careful steps to avoid slipping. Then, before entering the house, they turned back to the field. All fifty-seven stairs were still beautiful in the night sky.</p>\n<p>They sat at the porch.</p>\n<p>Then, they thought. Thought for a long while. About Aunt Shelley and how she was cut off by her- their mother.</p>\n<p>Well, it wasn't <em>really</em> being cut off. They didn't meet, didn't talk that much. But they still talked occasionally. Still were friendly. Just\u2026 strained.</p>\n<p>And Andy didn't want that. They really, really did not want that. Despite everything, despite all of the stress, Andy did not want to lose their mother early. They really didn't.</p>\n<p>They stood and entered the house, letting the warmth inside melt away any cool temperatures they had been in.</p>\n<p>And the house was just as cold.</p>\n<p>Up the stairs they went, entering their room and seeing their curtain-less window.</p>\n<p>They stopped in front of the window, staring out of it once more.</p>\n<p>Then they opened the window.</p>\n<p>Andy didn't know where to start. They were afraid. If it wasn't real, it would have already fallen apart. At any point over the months where Andy tried to prevent it.</p>\n<p>Even then, they tried to rationalize their fear. That it wouldn't be all too bad. But, they knew it would be hard going forward. They knew that there was a good chance they'd be beaten down at any turn. They knew that throughout the rest of their life, they'd fight an uphill battle that they could likely never win.</p>\n<p>And Andy accepted that. They would have to be ready to face it one day. Mayble not day one, but they had to get ready to face what would happen if such a truth were ever revealed.</p>\n<p>She closed the window, left the curtain open, and walked to bed.</p>\n<p>Tucked into the sheets, she let her eyes close, and drifted off to sleep.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Flight</th>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>Origin</th>\n<th>Destination</th>\n<th>Seat</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>202</td>\n<td>27/DEC/2023</td>\n<td>Pittsburgh, PA</td>\n<td>Denver, CO</td>\n<td>3C</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Departure:</strong> 06:30</p>\n<p><strong>Passenger Name:</strong> Andy Clarke</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>December 31,<br/>\n2023</p>\n<p>23:36</p>\n<hr/></div>\n<p>She stared into the mirror. She had been staring into it for a few minutes. It dawned on Andy's mind that she hadn't shaved ever since she had gotten back from Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>Whatever little hair she had on her head, she pulled back and tucked behind her ears. Shaving cream lathered her face and she grabbed a razor, using it with precision to cut every single strand of hair off of her face.</p>\n<p><em>Yet she hated how gritty her face felt as she rubbed her hands against it.</em></p>\n<p>So she shaved it again.</p>\n<p>And a third time.</p>\n<p>Until it felt /just a little bit// smoother.</p>\n<p>And that was all she felt she could do. When she moved to clean up, she saw her arms.</p>\n<p>Her hairy, horrendous arms.</p>\n<p>The sleeves on her arms were pulled up until they resembled a tank top. She slathered her left arm with shaving cream, then pressed her razor against it.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>She was done. Both arms. Where they were hairy and irritating, now they felt smooth.

Ever since.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> Have you been in Pennsylvania this whole time?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I got back a few days ago.</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> Have you seen my calls?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yeah. I'm sorry.</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> No- it's okay. I get it.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Uh huh?</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> I've just been worried.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Where are you right now?</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> At my apartment. Alone. Didn't really feel like partying.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yeah. Same here.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> Look, what I said- What I thought\u2026 I don't know what I'm trying to say right now. I guess I put together the nail polish and the mascara; thought that it was for you. That there was some part of you that you were hiding. And I wanted to support you if you were hiding it. I just didn't think it through.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> So I'm sorry.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> I really am.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> I understand if you don't forgive this - if you don't want to move in anymore.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> I just want to apologize for it.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I was also thinking about it. I thought about it a lot up until I left.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I also called my Aunt for the first time in a while during Christmas. It was nice. I got to chat with her, catch up with her.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I think that was the second calmest moment of my trip. There was this night that was beautiful, and I mean really pretty. It wasn't that cold, the clouds were gone, and it was quiet. I guess the best part about Appalachia is how there aren't many lights around there.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I remember stargazing for a while that night. Wasn't that what we did? The night before I went? Got drunk and stared at the sky.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> And then I just thought.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Nearly dozed off to sleep, too.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> You there?</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I don't think I'm a man. I don't think it is right for me to be a man anymore.</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> Do you think you're trans? Or non-binary?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I don't know. I would feel better - or at least think I would feel better - if I was a woman. But I don't think I'll ever come close to that, truly. So I don't know what I am realistically going to be, or are realistically.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I'm sorry for lashing out. I still- stand by what I said. Well, some of it. I'm still mad that you looked at my stuff when I was drunk. But, I think that I lashed out for the wrong reason. I was just\u2026 angry, I guess? At the idea that I was trans.</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> I'm sorry.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yeah. I'm still willing to move in, if you are.</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> Of course I am.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Really?</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> Yep.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Thank you. It means the world to me.</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> And you moving in with me, too.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Fireworks are going to go off soon.</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> What do you want me to call you?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> What?</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> Like, your name. Your pronouns. What do you want me to call you?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> You know-</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I don't think that I've thought about it.</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> I can use gender-neutral stuff, for now. If you would like.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I wouldn't mind being called she/her, at least for now.</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> Are you sure?</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Yep.</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> Okay.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> Of course.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> I'm going to hang up.</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> Alright.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Talk soon. Bye.</p>\n<p><strong>Quint:</strong> Bye.</p>\n</div>\n<p>A minute passed.</p>\n<p>Then, the fireworks went off. Andy stood up, looking around to make sure all of her windows were closed. She hated the smell of smoke. Andy lit a candle before returning to her couch.</p>\n<p>Andy pressed space, and resumed her movie.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<hr/>\n<p>January 1,<br/>\n2024</p>\n<p>00:02\u00a0A.M.</p>\n<hr/></div>\n<p>\u2026\u2026\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026\u2026\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026\u2026\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026\u2026\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026\u2026\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026\u2026\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026\u2026\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026\u2026\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026\u2026\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026\u2026\u2026..<br/>\n\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<hr/>\n<p>Febuary 25,<br/>\n2024</p>\n<p>11:42\u00a0A.M.</p>\n<hr/></div>\n<p>The car parked on the curb, only a few dozen feet away from Quint's apartment.</p>\n<p>The weather app had told her that it would be foggy in the morning. Bright beams of sunshine shone into her car directly on her face, taunting her.</p>\n<p>From her backpack, Andy produced a handmirror. Checking her makeup, it dawned on her that whatever little makeup she had on was rushed and shoddy.</p>\n<p>Much like before, her lipstick veered away from the track of her lips, her eyeliner was shaky, and she could easily point out how different the blush was to her skin color. Hell, even her nails seemed off. She felt them, noticing bumps and uneven application.</p>\n<p>Two whole hours had been spent to apply the makeup just to make it look presentable. Not good, not decent, but presentable!</p>\n<p>All so she could make a thirty-one-second walk to Quint's house and not be noticed.</p>\n<p>It was in vain, a stupid idea. She slammed her head back against her seat.</p>\n<p>The longer she stayed in the car the more likely it would be for more people to notice.</p>\n<p>She left and practically ran to Quint's door.</p>\n<p>Her clothes didn't match, either. Black cargo pants, a white long-sleeved undershirt, and a green branded t-shirt. They didn't match with her makeup. Anybody would instantly think that she was a boy pretending to be-</p>\n<p>She arrived at the door. Time slowed, every movement became heavy. Every breath she took was forced. A knock barely left her hand before she froze, feeling minutes pass.</p>\n<p>Then the door opened.</p>\n<p>Quing lunged at Andy with a hug.</p>\n<p>\"Hey Andy! How was the trip.\"</p>\n<p>Through the pressure on her lungs, she spoke.</p>\n<p>\"Good.\"</p>\n<p>\"I like your makeup.\"</p>\n<p>All of the pressure, all at once, faded.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you.\"</p>\n<p>\"How much do you have to unpack?\"</p>\n<p>\"A bit.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, let's go, then.\"</p>\n<p>The duo spent three hours to empty Andy's car and make trips to Andy's old apartment.</p>\n<p>It took two trips back to Andy's apartment to get everything.</p>\n<p>The last item the pair got was a Dutch oven. Andy had contemplated not bringing it, to just leave it behind. But they knew they had to keep it.</p>\n<p>She left the car and slowly carried the Dutch oven. She had to keep a slower pace to avoid dropping it. After two minutes, she arrived at her apartment door and brought the Dutch oven in with her.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Andy awoke. She turned over, and grabbed her phone. She checked the time.</p>\n<p><em>April 7, 4:37\u00a0A.M.</em></p>\n<p>She leaned back against her pillow. Her alarm wasn't supposed to go off until eight. Andy closed her eyes, trying to go back to sleep. After eleven minutes, she opened her eyes.</p>\n<p>Andy rolled out of her bed. She stretched, letting out a yawn as she grabbed a glass on her nightstand. She drank out of it, quickly finding it empty. Andy began to hobble to the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Andy took out her ice tray. She popped out three ice cubes, plopping them in the glass. She then went to the sink and filled her cup with tap water.</p>\n<p>Andy took out her phone.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4 id=\"toc47\"><span>Mom</span></h4>\n<hr/></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>I got a new apartment</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>with quint</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>When was this?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>yesterday</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why didn't you tell me about this?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>it was about the same as my current rent. a bit less, actually</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Okay.

Do not turn on the heat.</p>\n<p>Take the salami and cut into chunks. Peel and dice all six of your garlic cloves. Make sure that you have at least six cups of chicken broth/stock available, although have more ready if you can.</p>\n<p>Slice off the root of your leeks. Then, cut your leeks once length-wise down the middle. Chop all of your leeks from the whites up until the greek stalks become dry. Place all of the chopped leeks in the mixing bowl, and bring them to the sink. Begin to fill the bowl with water as you use your hands to massage the chopped leeks, doing so to remove all of the dirt and sediment. Fill up to the top of the bowl with water. The leeks should float at the top of your bowl.</p>\n<p>(Optionally peel your potatoes). Wash off your potatoes thoroughly to remove dirt and excess starch. Chop into small chunks.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3 id=\"toc62\"><span>Cooking:</span></h3>\n<p>In your cold pot, place all of your diced salami. Make sure that there is no water or oil in the pot. Turn the temperature up to medium-high (As the temperature of the pot increases, fat will render out of the salami. This should produce enough fat to dually cook the salami and all other ingredients you need to fry before putting in stock. Any other fatty meat would work as a substitute.). Let simmer for 2 - 5 minutes, until a thin layer of fat covers the pot. Begin stirring salami after one minute.</p>\n<p>After roughly a minute, add in your garlic. Let simmer for a further minute before removing the leeks from your bowl and place them into the pot (As said before, all of the leeks should float. Try to minimize the amount of water going into the pot. While some water is inevitable, putting in too much water with the leek will prevent the leeks from frying.).</p>\n<p><strong>DO NOT</strong> pour remaining water in the bowl down your sink. There should be visible amounts of sand and debris that sink down to the bottom of your bowl, which may be harmful for your drainage. The water is great to use for watering your plants. If not, simply pour the water outside.</p>\n<p>Stir frequently and let simmer for around three more minutes. After the time has passed, add in your potatoes. Stir roughly twice a minute for three minutes. (Cooking the potatoes and leeks ahead of boiling them helps the entire dish cook faster, as well as giving them browning and flavor.)</p>\n<p>When the potatoes are done simmering, add in enough chicken broth/stock. If you like thicker soups, make sure to add enough stock to just <em>barely</em> cover the other ingredients. If you like lighter soups, add in enough stock to cover the ingredients by one or two inches.</p>\n<p>With the stock in, turn the temperature up to high. While the soup begins to boil, add in both bay leaves and a tablespoon of brown sugar (Brown sugar makes every recipe taste better). Frequently stir and scrape the bottom of the pot to avoid burning.</p>\n<p>Once the soup has reached a boil, reduce the heat to low/medium-low and stir until the soup is reduced to a simmer. Let simmer for 15 - 30 minutes. Check your potatoes every 2 - 3 minutes starting at around ten minutes. Once your potatoes are easily piercable with a fork, they are ready.</p>\n<p>Add in your seasonings. You can choose different seasonings depending on your personal taste preferences. If you choose to add both salt and celery salt, make sure to minimize the amount of standard salt you apply accordingly to how much celery salt you put in (I personally only put half as much salt in as I do celery salt).</p>\n<p>Use your spatula to fish out both bay leaves. Add in your cup of cream. Add more or less cream depending on your desired coloration. No matter how much you add, let your cream simmer for a few minutes until it separates and a thin layer forms on the soup. This should also be accompanied by the soup thickening.</p>\n<p>Turn off your heat and take out your immersion blender. Puree the soup to your desired consistency.</p>\n<p>After you are done pureeing, add in your rosemary.</p>\n<p>Serve the soup in a bowl with a side of sourdough bread. Rip off chunks of the sourdough and dip in the soup to eat.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>- Andie Clarke</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/potato-leek-soup\">Potato Leek Soup</a>\" by VapidPoem, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Think it would be useful to know and whatnot.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Well, um. Yeah! Sure. Let me find it really quick.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Thank you.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nHorrid. It truly turned out as a horrid meal.\n\n\n\nNot when his mother made it, of course. But this was his first-ever attempt at even trying to cook. Ignore the noodles he boiled or the eggs he fried, this was a full-blown meal. His family's prized meal. A mean which he completely messed up.\n\n\n\nThe pantry revealed next-to-nothing aside from salt, pepper, butter, and garlic powder. Luckily, the grocery store was around a five-minute walk away.\n\n\n\nInside, he grabbed as much as he could remember as he hadn't bothered to write anything down.\n\n\n\n//A cheap can of dried thyme,//\n\n//A single, four-cup carton of chicken stock,//\n\n//The first six potatoes he saw,//\n\n//And a single head of garlic.//\n\n\n\nHis biggest pain was that he did not have or buy a vegetable peeler. Resorting to using a flimsy knife to cut off any skin or eyes, he chopped off at least a tenth of his total worth of potatoes.\n\n\n\nThe potatoes were unwashed. Before, during, and after they were prepared. Dirt which clung to the potato's skin clung to the knife, which rubbed off on the clean interiors of the potatoes as they were cut. All with the flawed reasoning that he had convinced himself of being that the potatoes would be cleaned off in the bowl of water.\n\n\n\nWhile a rough chop was called for the leeks, they were given an impatient hacking-at by Andy. No care was given to ensure that the leeks were clean. Large chunks of soil and earth remained attached to the leeks as they were finished being prepared.\n\n\n\nAt the very least, Andy didn't waste anything. He used //all// of the leeks. The roots, dried inedible leaves, and all.\n\n\n\nA realization dawned upon him at the last moment; he had no garlic crusher. Instead, he elected to use a mug to smash the garlic that was by some miracle peeled by him.\n\n\n\nWithout a Dutch oven he was left no choice other than to use a simple, standard pot. The temperature was far, //far// too high. Garlic and leeks burned the second they touched the pot. Even as he smelled smoke, he let the aromatics burn for the whole three-minutes as the recipe described before he added potatoes. Thankfully, the potatoes still had some water with them and didn't burn.\n\n\n\nWhatever little chicken stock he bought was not enough. It failed to cover all of the potatoes without even being simmered down yet.\n\n\n\nA second forgotten memory came back. He had not purchased bay leaves at the store. Pushed to the back of his mind, he added in all of the spices. For all three seasonings he used, they all were produced at such a fast speed that he had to have poured in at least twice of the seasonings that the recipe called for.\n\n\n\nUnstirred, the boiling potatoes overflowed twice after he tried to cover them.\n\n\n\nThe one thing Andy had remembered to purchase was a masher. He exerted nearly his full body weight on the masher to, unsuccessfully, grind the potatoes and leeks into chunks.\n\n\n\nAfter the fifteen minutes had passed, Andy turned off the heat and took the soup off of the burner.\n\n\n\nIt was hot. It was salty. It was peppery. It tasted charred. At times it felt like he was drinking sand. He would find long strands of poorly-chopped leeks that got stuck in his teeth. It was a struggle to choke down his pathetic excuse of a soup. While he did, he opened his phone.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++ Lauren\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n> Heyyy.

Even if the food was awful, he wouldn't let it go to waste.\n\n\n\nDespite his hardest attempts, he couldn't fully clean up. A residue wound up being stuck to the bottom of the pot that would never quite come off. //Likely some mix of burnt butter, garlic, and leeks.//\n\n\n\nLooking into the shopping bag, Andy remembered an impulse buy they had made.\n\n\n\n//An ice cube.//\n\n\n\nAlthough not much, it would at the very least make the tap water he hated taste cold.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n**Date Range:** ##transparent|..................................................## AUG/20 | AUG/26\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n[[size 200%]] Potential Earnings [[/size]]\n\n\n\n+ $457.65\n\n\n\n[[size 125%]] //Before Taxes & Deductions// [[/size]]\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n[[size 200%]] Total Time Punched [[/size]]\n\n\n\n+ 30:01\n\n\n\n[[size 150%]] //__- View Time Punch Details -__// [[/size]]\n\n\n\n~ 21/AUG/2023 - 04:07 Hours Worked\n\n~ 22/AUG/2023 - 06:01 Hours Worked\n\n~ 24/AUG/2023 - 06:15 Hours Worked\n\n~ 25/AUG/2023 - 08:32 Hours Worked\n\n~ 26/AUG/2023 - 05:36 Hours Worked\n\n\n\n[[size 150%]] //- Hide Time Punch Details -// [[/size]]\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nAndy grabbed a backpack and hastily shoved his nametag into it. He adorned a non-company sweater and left the breakroom. He walked to the parking lot. A car horn blared as it drove in front of him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Andy!\"\n\n\n\n\"Hey.\"\n\n\n\n\"You ready to leave?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yep.\n\n\n\nAndy throws their backpack into the backseat and sits in the passenger seat.\n\n\n\n\"So how have you been?\"\n\n\n\n\"Good, good.

Just try to change the recipe until you find something that you like.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nThree times.\n\n\n\nAndy thrice checked the shopping list. Seventeen days had passed since he had first tried making the soup. This time, he had prepared a list of the //right// amount of //all the ingredients// that he needed. This included all of the tools that he //should// need. Paramount being a new, $65 Dutch oven.\n\n\n\nWith a new vegetable peeler, the skin was easily peeled off of all of the potatoes as he needed them. Roots severed and leeks bisected, Andy ran the leeks under cold water and meticulously washed out any semblance of dirt and filth before chopping them. He still came close to having accidentally severed his fingers three times.\n\n\n\nIn unison, all of his preparation saw improvement.\n\n\n\nAnd even then, with all of his preparation and care, he still forgot the garlic crusher. Rather than use an old reliable mug, he elected to merely peel and chop the garlic. He reasoned that the bigger chunks would burn slower, anyways. Which was what it was about.\n\n\n\nThe Dutch oven was placed on the stove at a medium-low heat, as Andy now wanted to carefully raise the temperature. Still-cold butter was allowed to melt in the Dutch oven. Just enough butter had been saved from making toast that morning for it. Andy would have to run to the store to get more butter for the rest of the week, later. Finally, in went the garlic and leeks. That was it - it would be important for him to get it right. A new factor Andy had learned was to frequently stir to disperse heat and prevent burning via movement.\n\n\n\nNervousness overswept him. It didn't seem like there was enough fat in the Dutch oven. Maybe it was too wide? Maybe something else went wrong? Regardless as the seconds passed it became more and more likely to him that something was going to burn.\n\n\n\nAndy looked around his kitchen. He knew he was out of butter, with all that he had left being a bottle of olive oil. Without much time to think, he let a glug of olive oil into the Dutch oven. That was it. The pot began to sputter and hiss at him as the olive oil dispersed throughout it.\n\n\n\nYet, it seemed to do the trick. The veggies weren't charred. When three minutes passed, he added in stock to deglaze the pan and ensure that any burned surfaces were completely destroyed.\n\n\n\nThe rest of the cooking time was similar to his original attempt, albeit better executed. More stock, better chunks, and better mashing all contributed. He especially placed care on the seasonings he let into the soup in order to avoid another over-seasoned mess.\n\n\n\nWhen the soup was done, he turned off the burner and served it in a bowl. By this point, Andy knew that he had to wait for the soup to cool down. As he waited in anticipation, he made a call.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++ Mom\n\n+++++ Phone Call Record\n\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Hey Andy. What's up?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Not much. Just calling back to ask about the soup.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** What about it?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Just the recipe you sent me.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Yeah?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Are you sure you sent me the right recipe?

I don't know.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Well, I can double-check it. It might just be something on your end; lack of experience or whatnot. I ought to've taught you how to make it when you were here.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yeah...\n\n\n\n**Susan:** But I guess that means that you should visit me sometime soon, huh?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yep. Soon.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** You got a plan figured out yet?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Not yet. But - could you just send me the recipe again?

I'll send it to you again.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Thanks.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Love you.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Love you.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nHe waited, waited, waited. A wait for the soup to finally cool down. Once the wait had passed, he sipped his first bite of the soup. It was a great improvement of the first, truly. Yet it still didn't taste quite //right...//\n\n\n\nPresentable, sure. If he had been able to eat the first soup, this would be easy. But it still just tasted off, for whatever reason.\n\n\n\nBefore he knew it, the soup was gone. Immediately followed by him storing the soup in his fridge.\n\n\n\nAnd then came the dishes, utensils, and other implements that all sat around the kitchen. All of them, dirty.\n\n\n\nAndy pondered simply deciding to store them in the dishwasher, out of his sight and mind as they were roughly cleaned. Then he remembered his childhood, how often he pointed out dirt and residue on dishes only for his mother to dismiss him, claiming that he had OCD and was making a deal out of nothing.\n\n\n\nSo he got to work. It took nearly an hour, but he did it. All of the dishes were scrubbed clean of their sin by the time he was done.\n\n\n\nHis phone read //11:47 P.M.//. Which meant it was time for him to visit Quint and watch a movie.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nQuint pressed a button on their remote. It activated the television. While the streaming service loaded, Quint looked through their fridge.\n\n\n\n\"You want anything?\"\n\n\n\n\"Nah.\"\n\n\n\nThe fridge was then closed.\n\n\n\n\"I'm going to microwave some popcorn. You sure you don't want any?\"\n\n\n\n\"You know what? Fine.\"\n\n\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\n\n\nA single bag of popcorn was placed in the microwave. A few minutes passed before it was ready, at which point Quint tried to hand the bag to Andy.\n\n\n\n\"I'll wait.\"\n\n\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\n\n\"It's only a few minutes.\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay!\"\n\n\n\nWhen the second bag was ready, it was granted to Andy. He was joined by Quint as they jumped over the couch next to Andy.\n\n\n\n\"You ready?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\n\nA button on the remote was clicked. The opening credits of //The Thing// played.\n\n\n\nAt first, black completely filled the screen. Pure, empty black which was then broken by the opening credits of the movie. When the credits finished, fifty-seven stars littered the screen.\n\n\n\nOne of the stars transformed into a spaceship that zoomed toward the camera and then to Earth. The spaceship landed in a cold, desolate land also known as Antartica.\n\n\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nThe film ended with a shot of a bright fire which had engulfed the entirety of the facility, one that would inevitably burn it to the ground.\n\n\n\nA facility, built long before, soon to be nothing.\n\n\n\n\"What a movie.\" Andy remarked.\n\n\n\n\"I know, right?\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't know why I didn't see it sooner.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's probably my favorite movie, honestly.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. I see why.\"\n\n\n\nFixation overwhelmed him as the final seconds of the movie played. Specifically, he paid attention to just how bright the fire was. How it made a beacon which shone in an otherwise empty, dark, and baren landscape.\n\n\n\n\"Do you know what time it is?\"\n\n\n\nHe checked his phone.\n\n\n\n\"One fifty-three A.M.\"\n\n\n\n\"Jesus.\"\n\n\n\n\"Kinda getting late.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah... You know. Only a //bit// late.\"\n\n\n\n\"I should probably start heading back. I need to fix up my sleep schedule.\"\n\n\n\n\"That is a good idea, yeah.\"\n\n\n\nThe pair stood. Quint stretched as Andy checked his phone. While Quint stretched, they saw the back of their hand. Their nails adorned dark-purple nail polish.\n\n\n\n\"Hey Andy.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\n\n\"You ever had your nails done before?\"\n\n\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\n\n\n\"Do you want to have your nails done? Should only be about ten minutes.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sure.\n\n\n\nA set of nail polish is retrieved and brought before Andy. The set is opened and several unique shades are presented.\n\n\n\n\"Alright. Pick a color.\"\n\n\n\n\"This one.\"\n\n\n\n\"Black?\"\n\n\n\n\"Is that alright?\n\n\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\n\nHis hands eased while Quint guided them.\n\n\n\n\"Hold them steady. I don't want to get any polish on your skin.\"\n\n\n\nOver eleven minutes, Quint did Andy's nails. It took time for the polish to dry. But when it was dry, Andy held their new painted nails up in admiration.\n\n\n\n\"Wow.\"\n\n\n\n\"You like them?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah.

Even after a whole night's rest, it had-\n\n\n\nTheir alarm blared again, now reading 10:05 A.M.\n\n\n\nIt was quickly shut off, as well as the other seven alarms Andy had set to ensure he woke up around the right time every morning.\n\n\n\nTheir roommate's door was open. He was relaxed on his bed and typed on his phone. He barely elected to grant Andy a glance as Andy scurried by with their hand curled into a fist to ensure that their roommate didn't see their nails.\n\n\n\nIn the kitchen, Andy checked his balance.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++ Bank\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n[[<]]\n\n**Aunt Shelley** has sent you $275.00.\n\n\n\n//To help you out with the first few weeks of food for college.

With the lid removed, it was set in the microwave to cook for four minutes.\n\n\n\nA reflection was visible on the microwave. While faint, Andy really had no choice but to stare into it as the minutes passed. That was until Andy raised their hand, taking a glance at their nail polish. Now, despite being a less-close look, they saw the imperfections in their nails. Minor nicks, scratches, and all sorts of blemishes dotted their nails.\n\n\n\nThe faucet began pouring out water as they applied soap to their nails. There was a wait as the water began to heat. Nail polish on the edge of their nails where it met their skin curled. Andy picked at those curls in an attempt to peel off as much as they could.\n\n\n\nThe water got hotter, and hotter, //and hotter.// Until it was so hot that they yanked it back in pain.\n\n\n\nThen the microwave beeped, cutting them off.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nCold. It was cold. The soup was cold. Not hot, not warm, not lukewarm, but cold. They would have put it back into the microwave to heat it further, except that merely feeling the soup seemed to overwhelm Andy with a sense of vertigo - making them sit down.\n\n\n\nA decision was reached to just eat the cold soup. Beside, Andy heard something about potato leek soup traditionally being served cold. Surely this would be good.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nAbhorrent. An abhorrent, abnormally uninviting soup in stark contrast to the presentable soup the prior night.\n\n\n\nStill, Andy scarfed it down.\n\n\n\nWhen Andy had finished the soup, they walked to the sink and cleaned it. The soup seemed to easily wash away. At least, wash away much easier than their nail polish had. Andy looked at their nails one last time, noting how they looked similar to when they had awoken.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n----\n\n+++ Grocery List\n\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n* 6x Potatoes\n\n* 1x Carton of Milk\n\n* 12x Cans of Soda\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nThe cashier scanned Andy's select few items.

Andy put all of the groceries they had bought into their fridge and cupboards.\n\n\n\nAfter the last grocery is put in the fridge, they take out the final portion of potato leek soup. Their roommate is nowhere to be seen, although Andy assumed they had eaten some of it.\n\n\n\nSix minutes. The soup spent six minutes in the microwave. By the time it was done, it was so hot that Andy needed oven gloves to remove it. They knew it would be a while before it cooled down to a point of edibility.\n\n\n\nRather than wait, Andy opened their freezer and pulled out the ice cube tray. They popped out a single ice cube and dropped it in the soup, using their spoon to stir it around.\n\n\n\nWhen they took a sip, the soup was palatable. Better than being eaten cold and arguably better than the night it was cooked, but still just not quite there.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[size 125%]] Hello, Andy!

As they drove away, Andy moved to knock on Quint's door.\n\n\n\n\"Hey Andy. Come in!\"\n\n\n\nThey enter the house.\n\n\n\n\"Who was that?\"\n\n\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\n\n\"That person who just left your apartment. I saw them walking out.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, yeah. That's my roommate.

Although I did read something about how he ended up hating his hair.\"\n\n\n\n\"You ready?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yep.\n\n\n\nIt took a minute, but Quint retrieved thirteen different shades of nail polish and brought them to the table in front of Andy.\n\n\n\n\"Pick one.\"\n\n\n\n\"Black is fine.\"\n\n\n\n\"Pick another.\"\n\n\n\n\"Dark blue?\"\n\n\n\n\"And another.\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't know.

You're going to want to start with the nail base-\"\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nLate at night, Andy laid in bed and watched videos on their phone. Video after video on Youtube of short, two-to-five-minute-long nail polish tutorials.\n\n\n\nA method they had been taught by their scrolling was finally fully functionally devised.\n\n\n\nBefore Andy could enact it, they moved to their bathroom with nail polish. They tried as hard as they could to be quiet as they knew their roommate was asleep.\n\n\n\nA bottle of nail polish remover was opened, soon placed on Andy's nails in an effort to wear out the paint.\n\n\n\nOne minute passed. Then two minutes. Then three minutes.\n\n\n\n//Then five minutes.//\n\n\n\nAfter exactly seven minutes a nozzle is turned and hot water begins to pour out of the faucet. Nail polish which touched Andy's skin had already began to peel and curl up. Andy grabbed the nail polish and meticulously peeled off as much as they could.\n\n\n\nStreaks and dots of nail polish once again littered their nails. Running their nails under the hot water did help, although specks of nail polish remained never-the-less.\n\n\n\nA short trip to the kitchen saw Andy grab a few sheets of paper towels before they retreated to their room.\n\n\n\nThe paper towels were strewn on the table. Andy grabbed the dark purple nail polish, nail base, and coat.\n\n\n\nNail base came first. It flowed along his nails, although admittedly a bit too much was applied.\n\n\n\nThen came the first layer of nail polish. Although inconsistent in its application, it generally avoided overlap onto their skin.\n\n\n\nFive minutes passed.\n\n\n\nThen came the second layer of nail polish. Now, it coated every atom of their nails and more. In several cases it fell onto their skin.\n\n\n\nAndy picked away at the excess nail polish with a nail file attached to their nail clipper to scrape off as much as they could. But still a thin layer solidified within seconds of it being applied, fusing to their skin.\n\n\n\nFive minutes passed.\n\n\n\nAnd the coat was applied over all of the polish.\n\n\n\nWhat Andy was left with was obvious. //A disaster.// Their nails were bumpy, the nail polish looked ugly, nail polish had gotten stuck under their nails. It was a fiasco.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, it hardly mattered. It was //theirs.// They had applied the nail polish on their own. Never mind the imperfections, Andy was left in admiration of their work.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nIn the parking lot, Andy was left in panic. It was a quick trip, with them only needing to grab one item.\n\n\n\nBut, their nails remained. Near-pristine. //As pristine as shoddily-applied nail polish could be.//\n\n\n\nWhen they left their car their fingers were curled into a fist. It was enough for Andy to feel comfortable walking in public with markings on their nails.\n\n\n\nTwenty-seven seconds passed after Andy entered the store. They passed a clothing aisle. A previously fast pace slowed down as an outfit got caught in the corner of their eye.\n\n\n\nA mannequin adorning a long, brown pocketed skirt, a mini-belt, and a long-sleeved brown shirt.\n\n\n\nTheir phone rang.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++ Mom\n\n+++++ Phone Call Record\n\n----\n\n\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Andy!\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Hey.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Is now a good time to talk for a bit?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Not really.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Aww.

But still.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** So, yeah... To be frank, I'm not sure that I like my roommate too much.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Really?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yeah. He's been eating all my food, not doing dishes. All that stuff.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Well that's just what happens when you rent your own place. Stuff isn't so easy.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** And that wouldn't have happened in dorms?\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Really?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** What?\n\n\n\n**Susan:** People had a lot more manners back when I was in the dorms. When I moved out-\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Hang on- I need to grab something real quick. I'll have to call you back later.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Well, hang on. Just another minute or two?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yeah... Sure.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** How's that soup coming along for ya? Did you have the right recipe?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yeah, I did.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Did it work out better the second time around?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yeah. Did end up tweaking the recipe around a bit.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** What?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yeah. I think my stovetop is wonky. Had to adjust the heat, add in a bit of olive oil.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Andy! You should have called me first.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I mean - I did. Just, right before I started cooking.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** You- ... Andy, you know what I meant.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Oh? Sorry, then. Don't see how it was that big of a deal.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** What did you change with it? What was the whole recipe you used?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Um. Pretty much the same recipe? I just changed around the cooking time a little bit.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Okay. What was the whole recipe.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I don't remember-\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Well, there you go! That's cause you didn't follow a recipe. And now you're complaining about how it turned out bad.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Mom-\n\n\n\n**Susan:** What?!\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I don't remember it off the top of my head!\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Do you have a copy of it?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Not right now.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Uh huh?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** All that I changed was the cooking time because I burned the garlic the first time.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Why?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** One of my friends suggested it.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Who?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** His name is Quint. They-\n\n\n\n**Susan:** What was the greater context surrounding that?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I just brought it up.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** All do respect to Quint, whoever he is-\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Quint doesn't go-\n\n\n\n**Susan:** -but this recipe has been in our family for generations and generations. All due respect to him, but I trust the family recipe more than him. You know?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yup...\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Andy, here's my idea. I think you should try the recipe a few more times before you alter it to your own taste. That sound good?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yeah. I mean, I was kinda planning on that. Changing it around until I know exactly how to avoid mistakes and all.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** But, I want you to call me whenever you make it. No listening to friends or making up how to cook it on the fly. Instead I need you to let me in on everything you do. Okay?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Okay...\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nDeep breaths. Deep, deep breaths.\n\n\n\nBreathing did not help.\n\n\n\nAndy tried to continue their search toward the store. They just needed an immersion blender for the soup. Nothing else.\n\n\n\nThey found their legs becoming stiff, which did not help Andy as their pace nearly tripled. Sweat formed on their brow. It dripped down their forehead into their eye. Whatever control Andy had of their breathing vanished as Andy found themself unable to breath.\n\n\n\nThen Andy saw a unisex bathroom. Without a second thought, the door was opened then slammed behind them with nearly full force. The door was locked behind them.\n\n\n\nIt took nineteen paces around the small, cramped room for Andy to finally breathe again.\n\n\n\nNow able to breathe, they sat on the toilet for five minutes. With a jolt, they rose to the mirror. Their eyes had gotten beet red, although no tears had formed.\n\n\n\nTheir thumb and index finger moved to their sinus and pinched hard. A minute passed and Andy swallowed.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++ Mom\n\n+++++ Phone Call Record\n\n----\n\n\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Yes?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I just wanted to say something else-\n\n\n\n**Susan:** What is it?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I just wanted to talk a bit about the recipe - what I am thinking about it and whatnot.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Okay. What about it?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** It was just... being put on the spot like that. Randomly called. I wasn't really able to think what I wanted to say, you know?\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Uh huh?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** But, yeah...\n\n\n\n**Susan:** What is that echo, by the way?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Nothing.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Nothing?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** It's just a bathroom. I wanted some privacy.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** You wanted some- Jesus Christ, this is to yell at me, isn't it?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** No-\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Andy, just say what you want to say. I can't do this.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I'm not going to yell at you.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** So what is it?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** It's just more- what I'm thinking is that I change the recipe a bit while I learn how to cook. Avoid burning things and everything like that.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** And that just applies to cooking temp?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Mostly. I'm also getting an immersion blender-\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Andy...\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Because I don't like how chunky I cut the potatoes.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Andy! That's one of the biggest parts of the recipe! It's supposed to have chunks in it.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I don't... really agree with that. I just think-\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Sorry, but I don't think you're making the same soup anymore.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** It's just one thing-\n\n\n\n**Susan:** It's two. The temp, now this. Next you're going to tell me something else, and then something else. It's not the same soup anymore, just admit that.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Mom! I-\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Stop. I told you that I can't argue right now.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Okay then! Sorry.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** So stop yelling at me, stop arguing with me, and be honest with me that it isn't just that.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** It was just the temp thing. The blending thing's only something that I might do.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Might?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I don't know. Just see if I like it more.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** I think you're changing your answers now; which I don't really like.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** That was always what I was going to do.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** I don't like it when you lie to me, sweetie.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I just-\n\n\n\n**Susan:** You know what, Andy? I'm not doing this, today. I've barely had any energy today and I just can't argue with you right now. You can't admit when you're wrong and just keep lying and I... I just can't.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Sorry...\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Look- Andy, I love you. But that's not the same soup and it won't ever be. Unless you change it back, it's fundamentally different. And lets just leave it at that. Agreed?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yep.\n\n\n\n**Susan:** I'm going to go. I have to take a shower. Love you.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Love you...\n\n\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nThe call ends.\n\n\n\nThey let out a scream.\n\n\n\nA scream they hoped wasn't heard by anyone. Really, really hoped.\n\n\n\nIt took another twenty-three paces to calm down. When they stopped, they looked in the mirror. The sight of their reflection overcame them with a need to cry.\n\n\n\nTheir best effort to suppress their tears were in vain. It couldn't be held in forever. As he realized that truth, Andy let themself cry for only one minute.\n\n\n\nA paper towel was produced by the dispenser and used to soak up any water around Andy's eyes. Still, they were bloodshot. At best, Andy hoped that the cashier would think they were high.\n\n\n\nIt took them a lot, but they managed to convince themself to leave the bathroom.\n\n\n\nThere was no point in getting the immersion blender anymore. So they went to leave the store. Two employees looked at them, an act that confirmed they had heard Andy's scream.\n\n\n\nRight before they left, Andy's eye was caught once more. The outfit. On a discount, no less.\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n$45.99\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nAnd it was silly. They didn't have that much to spare - couldn't afford any split-second purchases.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nExcept they could. It was priced the same as an immersion blender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndy looked around for a price tag. Eventually, Andy found that it was priced at $45.99. Andy didn't know if they had that much to spare. Nor why they were even considering it.\n\n\n\nBut, they had decided not to buy the immersion blender. They would, in all likelihood, be a similar price. Andy toiled and considered.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\"Will that be all for the day?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\n\n\"Total should be around $45.99.\"\n\n\n\nThe cashier was handed a credit card.\n\n\n\n\"It's for my sister.\"\n\n\n\n\"Uh huh?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. Her birthday is coming up. Wanted to get her something nice.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, she must be pretty lucky. It's a pretty nice dress.\"\n\n\n\n\"It really is.\"\n\n\n\n\"Would you like a receipt?\"\n\n\n\n\"No thank you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Have a great day.\"\n\n\n\nThey knew.\n\n\n\nThe cashier knew.\n\n\n\nAndy could see it in their eyes.\n\n\n\nOutfit in hands, they left the store as fast as they could, getting in their car and screaming.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++ Roommate\n\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n> You going to be here tonight?\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n> No.\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\n\n> Where are you going to be at?\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n> A party.\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\n\n> Okay.\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n> Why?\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\n\n> Just curious.\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nEven though their roommate would be gone, Andy instinctively locked themself in their bathroom.\n\n\n\nThey took off their jacket, then their belt, then their jeans, then their shirt, then their socks, and finally their boxers.\n\n\n\nAnd then they were nude. Completely.\n\n\n\nImmediately followed was a feeling of relief. Their clothes had been a bit tight on them.\n\n\n\nAndy glanced over at the door to confirm it was locked. With the final confirmation, Andy opened the bag.\n\n\n\nThree components.\n\n\n\nA skirt. A shirt. And a belt.\n\n\n\nIt quickly dawned on them that they would need a bra and panties to comfortably complete the set.\n\n\n\n//Complete the set?!//\n\n\n\nThey hardly knew why they bought the outfit in the first place. Yet, they put it on piece-by-piece-by-piece, followed by a glance in the mirror.\n\n\n\nAnd they were beautiful.\n\n\n\nAlthough not the perfect fit, the clothes were the most comfortable thing Andy had ever worn. It fit their shape well, the fabric was soft. Oh, it was soft.\n\n\n\nAndy began to cry. Not tears of stress, exhaustion. Rather tears of emotion, elation.\n\n\n\nAndy turns, and turns, and turns, and turns, and turns. They adore every angle, every aspect of their outfit.\n\n\n\nIt takes five minutes before Andy seems to snap out of adoration. They mechanically exit the bathroom and retreat to their bedroom, electing to lock the door before they passed out on their bed.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n> || Missed Call: Quint //8:42 P.M.// ||\n\n\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n> || Missed Call: Quint //8:44 P.M.// ||\n\n\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n\n\n> || Missed Call: Quint //8:47 P.M.// ||\n\n\n\n\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++ Quint\n\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[<]]\n\n> heyyyy\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n> r u okay?\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n> anyways, was wondering if u wanted to head to my place later.\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n> just to watch a movie\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n> let me know when u get this.\n\n[[/<]]\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n\n\n.......\n\n.......\n\n.......\n\n.......\n\n.......\n\n.......\n\n.......\n\n\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n> Sorry.

Now naked, Andy rushed to put on a t-shirt, boxers, pajama pants, and a matching flannel before they were ready.\n\n\n\nThe removed clothing was crammed into a ball and thrown on their bed.\n\n\n\nThey sighed, then remembered that the previous night they had planned to make potato leek soup, but never did.

Andy had very, very closely followed the original recipe. Even with a call to their mother, it didn't work.\n\n\n\nSame temp, same cooking time, same ratios, same ingredients, and a same everything as the recipe had called for.\n\n\n\nAndy tried their best to eat the soup. They had eaten every other soup before. Every other, awful soup. They only managed to get a few bites in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++ Mom\n\n+++++ Phone Call Record\n\n----\n\n\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yeah, Mom?\n\n\n\n**Susan:** Just checking in to see how the soup's doing.\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yeah.

It just had to.\n\n\n\nAll of the soup they had made was inedible. It was disgusting, //repulsing// to eat.\n\n\n\nSo much food went to waste all in a single moment. They went to their fridge to find some food, //any food.//\n\n\n\nBefore they could choose, they ran to the bathroom and vomitted.\n\n\n\nWhen they finished, they wiped the vomit off of their lip and went to their bedroom. Seeing a glass of water, they emptied it.\n\n\n\nAnd collapsed on their bed.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nTossed and turned, turned and tossed. They tossed around for twenty-seven minutes.\n\n\n\nAll they wanted was to be able to close their eyes and rest. But, they couldn't.\n\n\n\nAndy shot up, sitting in their bed. They turned, their eyes locking almost like a magnet to the dress that laid on their bed.\n\n\n\nWith a single motion, they grabbed the dress. Their nausea seemingly having faded away.\n\n\n\nThe soft fabrics melted in their hands, each silky fiber feeling soft and beautiful as ever.\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\nThen,\n\n\n\nwithout a single reason,\n\n\n\nthey tore the dress.\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nFirst in half, then in fourths, then in eigths, then in sixteenth...\n\n\n\nWithin moments, it was reduced to scraps and shreds. Andy made very well sure to give the other parts of the outfit attention. The belt was snapped, the sleeves ripped off the shirt before themself being halved.\n\n\n\nMassive holes were ripped through the shirt until it was nothing but a rag.\n\n\n\nFive minutes passed. Shreds laid in Andy's hands and around their room.\n\n\n\nThey breathed and picked up what scraps they could to throw any away.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++ Quint\n\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n> You want to eat out?\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuint had arrived.

She freaked //the fuck// out.\"\n\n\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't even know, man. The temp? I guess.\"\n\n\n\n\"Jesus. That's rough.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's just like... A //really, really// small part of the recipe and she was freaking out about it.\"\n\n\n\n\"What happened after that?\"\n\n\n\n\"She called me a few more times the next time I made soup.\"\n\n\n\n\"Still freaking out?\"\n\n\n\n\"Still freaking out.

You really care that much about whether I simmer garlic on medium, or low heat when I'm just fucking starting to learn how to cook enough to yell at me for it.\"\n\n\n\n\"But you liked it.\"\n\n\n\n\"The one with the changed recipe, yeah. You know - I made some earlier, followed the recipe word-for-word, and it still tasted like shit.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's definitely because you just haven't tried it enough.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, yeah.\"\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\"When are you leaving?\"\n\n\n\n\"The 21st.

Doctor's orders.\"\n\n\n\n\"What are you thinking of?\"\n\n\n\n\"Something small. Probably having drinks at a park or something.\"\n\n\n\n\"That sounds fun.\"\n\n\n\n\"So you're down?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\n\n\"Radical.\"\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\"Like your roommate?\"\n\n\n\n\"Kinda.\"\n\n\n\n\"So that's not a yes?\"\n\n\n\n\"I didn't say I don't.\"\n\n\n\n\"Because, my roommate is dropping out of college.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. She found a high-paying job and didn't need her diploma.\"\n\n\n\n\"Good for her.\"\n\n\n\n\"So that means that I have an open room.\"\n\n\n\n\"Uh huh?\"\n\n\n\n\"//And// I don't want to pay two people's rent by myself. Don't really want to move, either.\"\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\"You get what I'm saying?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'll have to think about it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Just let me know soon.\"\n\n\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\n\n.....\n\n\n\n.....\n\n\n\n.....\n\n\n\n.....\n\n\n\n.....\n\n\n\nIt was dark when Andy's door opened. Despite just eating, they were hungry.\n\n\n\nThe fridge door opened and the note they had left was gone. //As well as one of their energy drinks...//\n\n\n\nIt was at that moment Andy decided to move out.\n\n\n\nThey grabbed pre-cooked, cold spaghetti noodles out of the fridge. Rather than microwave them, Andy put grated parmesan on them and moved to their room with a fork to eat them cold.\n\n\n\nNot bothering to turn on a light, they sat in front of their laptop and quickly finished the pasta. A sigh left Andy's mouth as they looked at an essay they had to write.\n\n\n\n400 words done.\n\n\n\n3,000 words needed.\n\n\n\nA clock read //10:52 P.M.//\n\n\n\nThey had time, plenty of time. They just needed to write.\n\n\n\n//11:55 P.M.//\n\n\n\n500 words done.\n\n\n\n3,000 words needed.\n\n\n\nThe laptop screen was left open as they moved to their bed. Curled up in a ball, facing away from the light, and they eventually saw a scrap.\n\n\n\nDespite being only a thousandth of the original's glory, it had all the pull. Both eyes locked on the shred as their hand outstretched to grab it.\n\n\n\nAndy let out a gentle laugh.\n\n\n\n\"Must've been poor quality- with how easy it was to tear...\"\n\n\n\nThey wrapped their body around a pillow, cooling off with shred still in hand.\n\n\n\n\"Wouldn't have lasted if I wore it more than once...\"\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n\n\n//Wore it where?//\n\n\n\n//In their room?//\n\n\n\n//In public?!//\n\n\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nNo no, they wouldn't have. It made sense for them to rip it; they didn't need it. They simply didn't.\n\n\n\nYet Andy did not know why they were holding on to the last scrap of fabric so tightly.\n\n\n\n//12:21 A.M.//\n\n\n\nThey went to their desk and shook their cursor around to turn on the screen. Fingers on the keys, they prepared to keep writing.\n\n\n\nUntil they brought out a pen and paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nMystique -- Lash False Lash Effect Mascara -- Adds Volume & Lengthening -- Cruelty & Paraben-Free\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n$3.49\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nEllanie's Prime Remain All Day Red Lipstick, Matte -- Long-Lasting Color Wear -- No Transfer or Bleed -- Hydrating & Non-Irritating for Soft Lips\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n$5.97\n\n[[/>]]\n\n----\n\n\n\nBlack Tone Lip Stick for Soft Lips -- Hydrating & Non-Irritating -- Perfect Gift For Your Girlfriend\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n$6.49\n\n[[/>]]\n\n----\n\n\n\nPROFFESSIONAL MAKEUP EYELINER Used By Celebrities -- Waterproof Pattented Formula -- Black Tone\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n$18.57\n\n[[/>]]\n\n----\n\n\n\nINSTANT Cheekbone Contour Peach Perfection, .33 Oz, Non-Irritating Materials to Enhance Natural Radiance\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n$5.97\n\n[[/>]]\n\n----\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n++ **Subtotal (5 item):**\n\n++++ $40.51\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\u00a0\n\nThree hours were needed to watch makeup tutorials on Youtube, or trying to figure out how to grow a wolfcut.\n\n\n\nAndy checked their bank account.\n\n\n\n//$205.60//\n\n\n\nAndy sighed what they thought was a sigh of a relief. An excuse why they didn't buy it. They couldn't drop 1/5th of their money on makeup! Not at the moment.\n\n\n\nAnd then Andy remembered how much cheaper it was to buy things in person vs online...\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nThe cashier didn't believe them. There was no way. Literally no way. It was like when Andy bought the dress.\n\n\n\nThey claimed it to be for Christmas shopping, a gift for their mother. The cashier didn't buy it for a second. At the very least, they //suspected// it. Buying //all of that makeup// for one person who'd likely //already have it?!//\n\n\n\nAndy only hoped.\n\n\n\nThey locked the bathroom door behind them and dropped the bag on the counter. Their roommate was there, so they had to be careful.\n\n\n\nAndy started with the eyeliner - which was shakily applied. It curved and swayed as dots of skin peeked out throughout both of their upper eyelids.\n\n\n\nNext up - the blush. The kit came with four different colors. The initial blush that Andy applied hardly matched their skin tone. Andy grabbed a wet towel and tried to wipe off the blush. Yet, it persisted. After Andy's face was dried off, Andy tried to apply a different kind of blush. All that Andy was left with were patches of dust that clinged to their face that were either too red or too pale for their skin tone.\n\n\n\nThen; the lipstick. They went with the red lipstick. The lipstick overlapped from their lips to their skin until they were left with a bumpy, shoddily applied red coating their lips.\n\n\n\nThe only thing that could save the day was the mascara. Their eyelashes were coated, and came off being longer. Much to Andy's shagrin, the mascara was hardly noticeable.\n\n\n\nEven with it being the best application, tiny dots of black which stemmed from the mascara hit their upper eyes.\n\n\n\nAndy looked into the mirror to see an object of horror. Although recognizable who was behind the mask, it was a hard sight.\n\n\n\nYet, the tiniest twinge of pride overcame them. It was their first time trying and not all that bad. But they simply couldn't avoid how bad it looked at first.\n\n\n\nAndy heard their roommate walking throughout the house and sighed. They grabbed the towel and cleaned their face.\n\n\n\n//Then nothing came off.//\n\n\n\nThe towel was soaked in water before being applied directly on their face. They panicked, scrubbing as hard as they could to get it off.\n\n\n\n//It was water resistant. All of it was!//\n\n\n\nThey glanced into the mirror, seeing the makeup merely smudge on their face without coming off.\n\n\n\nTheir roommate would certainly notice if they saw. They would notice, and they would //judge//. Especially for how bad the makeup was.\n\n\n\nAndy jumped into the shower and turned on the water. It was still freezing cold, and it remained freezing for the rest of the shower.\n\n\n\nWhen they finished, they dried off their face and looked into the mirror.\n\n\n\nRemnants of the makeup stayed, but they were more discrete. Much of their eyeliner and lipstick had washed off. All that remained was a hardly-noticeable shadow of the makeup they had just tried to apply.\n\n\n\nAs the bathroom door unlocked, they saw their roommate.\n\n\n\nThey were concise and told the roommate that they planned to move out soon.\n\n\n\nThe roommate asked why.\n\n\n\nAndy told them why.\n\n\n\nThe roommate asked what day.\n\n\n\nAndy said that they did not know.\n\n\n\nThe roommate confirmed that Andy was leaving the house.\n\n\n\nAnd Andy affirmed them.\n\n\n\nThen the roommate wished them well, and thanked them for letting them know.\n\n\n\nAnd that was it. Andy walked into their room and picked up their phone.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++ Quint\n\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n> I can move in with you if you're still looking for someone.\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n> cool\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\n\n>Text me the details.\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nAndy set down their phone.

The beer is handed to Quint, who shoves the six-pack into their backpack.\n\n\n\nThe pair follow a trail into the woods just into the Rockies.\n\n\n\nAfter roughly seventeen minutes, the pair arrived at a clearing slightly off-trail. Quint took out a blanket to place on the grass while Andy kicked off their shoes and felt the blades of grass beneath their toes.\n\n\n\nTwo bottles of beer were popped.\n\n\n\n\"Feels like forever since we've hung out, huh?\"\n\n\n\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\n\n\n\"Especially since we've gone out here.\"\n\n\n\n\"We should come out here more.

While Andy had moved to lay on the blanket, Quint decided to lay on the grass, at least briefly.\n\n\n\nThe pair stared into the stars for thirty-one minutes all while sipping their beers.\n\n\n\nAt a point during the night, Andy had grabbed a third beer. By the time they were back in the car, the bottle was empty. The bottle Quint had nursed was thrown away in a trash can they found, still half-full.\n\n\n\nAs the pair entered the car, Quint turned on a light to search it.\n\n\n\n\"What are you looking for?\"\n\n\n\n\"My keys.\"\n\n\n\n\"You know- you... you probably shouldn't just leave those in the car...\"\n\n\n\n\"Heh. Probably.\"\n\n\n\nThe search effort is joined by Andy. After a minute, the pair briefly lock eyes.\n\n\n\n\"Andy.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\n\n\"Are you wearing mascara?\"\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\"No, no.\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\n\nQuint discovered the key, put it in the ignition, then drove away.\n\n\n\nA chuckle left Andy's lips and they closed their eyes, leaning against their seat and nearly falling asleep.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nA key slid into the door, and it was opened.\n\n\n\n\"Let's get you into bed.\"\n\n\n\nThey practically had to drag Andy to their room where they opened a door, turned on a light, and eased Andy into bed. They helped Andy remove their shoes and tuck themselves under the sheets.\n\n\n\n\"I'm going to hang out here a minute- while I wait for a cab.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, no- no... Don't. You can just- just take my car and give it to me tomorrow.\"\n\n\n\n\"You're sure?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, yeah. Yeah... Just have a good night.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sleep tight.\"\n\n\n\nThe keys to Andy's car slides into Quint's pocket.\n\n\n\nRight as they reached the door, they turned to shut off the light.\n\n\n\nThen something caught their eye.\n\n\n\n//Blush,//\n\n//Eyeliner,//\n\n//Red Lipstick,//\n\n//Black Lipstick,//\n\n//Mascara,//\n\n//and Nail Polish.//\n\n\n\nAll neatly packed into the corner.\n\n\n\nThey picked up one of the nail polish bottles, at which point they confirmed that it was the exact same as they had given to Andy.\n\n\n\nThe cap of the lipstick popped off, and it was clearly used. Smeared in only a way that application, rough application, could do.\n\n\n\nThey approached Andy to look at their eyes and confirm that they were wearing mascara. With the confirmation, Quint left the room while they shut off the light behind them.\n\n\n\n\"Best of dreams.\"\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nTwo potatoes. Both were washed as they had decided to make a scaled-down version of the recipe for lunch, and likely dinner/breakfast.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++ Quint\n\n+++++ Phone Call Record\n\n----\n\n\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n**Andy:** Yeah?\n\n\n\n**Quint:** Hey.

Then, add crushed cloves of garlic and your chopped leeks and let simmer for approximately 3 minutes at medium heat. Add in your potatos and let simmer for a further minute. Then add in your salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Add in all of your chicken broth/stock. Increase the temp to bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and add your thyme and bay leaves. Let simmer for 15 minutes.\n\n\n\nAfter 15 minutes, try to pierce the potatoes with a fork. If you can pierce them with no resistance, turn off the heat. Fish out the bay leaves, and mash the soup.

It had been thirty minutes since Andy had tried to start falling asleep. Their plane was set to leave next morning and they wanted any small amount of sleep.\n\n\n\nBut their curtain was broken, as it had always been. Light shone directly on their face.\n\n\n\nAndy wondered what awaited them when they returned. After all, Quint was convinced of something that flat out wasn't true. Something that Andy was not.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nAlthough the makeup was suspicious. Obviously Quint shouldn't of looked, but Andy...\n\n\n\n...stood up and tried to yank the curtain close. Doing so saw barely anything change as moonlight still flooded the room.\n\n\n\nThey crawled back into bed then covered themself in sheets.\n\n\n\n//What about their mother?// She had been in bad health for such a long time, Andy considered. They knew she wouldn't be around forever. If Andy ever wanted to tell her something that they'd regret not letting her know, they'd have to say it soon.\n\n\n\nFortunately, //there was absolutely nothing that Andy needed to say.//\n\n\n\nAside from them starting to wear nail polish. Although they wouldn't really feel bad over not telling them that.\n\n\n\n//But what about the mascara? They'd been wearing that almost every day before they left.//\n\n\n\nAnd the //lipstick.//\n\n\n\nAnd the //blush.//\n\n\n\nAnd the //eyeliner.//\n\n\n\nBut they reasoned that they had only tried those things once and immediately washed them off.\n\n\n\n//Only because their roommate was there. What if they were alone? Would they still have washed it off so quickly?//\n\n\n\nEven then, they were all just minor things to Andy. Stylistic things that weren't exactly major secrets...\n\n\n\nBut-\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++ ##cyan|What## ##pink|if## ##silver|Quint## ##pink|was## ##cyan|right?##\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nThey stormed out of their bed to the curtain and grabbed both sides of it. Andy slammed together both curtains with such forced that the curtain rod was knocked off of the wall. It fell to the ground.\n\n\n\nThey sighed and leaned to pick up the curtain. Before they put it back, Andy stared out the window.\n\n\n\nAnd then they opened it.\n\n\n\nThey inhaled the cool, crisp air as it rushed past them. It wasn't too cold for a winter's night. They looked down at a field just a bit below them.\n\n\n\nWith a second thought, Andy adorned a jacket and moved downstairs.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nThey walked through the field. Snow crunched under each footstep. It took effort to avoid the tangled amalgamation of roots and dead plants while making their way through the field.\n\n\n\nBut, they made it. A small clearing where they begun to breathe what felt like the freshest air they had in years. Only two sounds were heard, Andy's breaths and the gentle breeze of the wind.\n\n\n\nThey looked up into the sky. Fifty-seven stars littered it. A burning fire that shone all the way across the universe just so Andy could glimpse it.\n\n\n\nThey sat on the ground. Their coat was waterproof, allowing them to have some protection.\n\n\n\nThen they zoned out and enjoyed the cosmos. When they returned, they had no idea how much time they had lost.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nThey were terrified. Terrified of the repercussions of it, of what it would mean if it were true.\n\n\n\nTheir whole life - everything they have had up until a few months prior, wasn't what they were.\n\n\n\nAnd what if they did tell their mother? What if they were disowned? What if their mother spent the last few months of her life hating her-\n\n\n\n-hating them.\n\n\n\nThey shiverred. It was cold. They knew it was time for them to go back.\n\n\n\nThey stood, feeling that snow had gotten through their coat. Somehow.\n\n\n\nAt the icy porch, Andy took careful steps to avoid slipping. Then, before entering the house, they turned back to the field. All fifty-seven stairs were still beautiful in the night sky.\n\n\n\nThey sat at the porch.\n\n\n\nThen, they thought. Thought for a long while. About Aunt Shelley and how she was cut off by her- their mother.\n\n\n\nWell, it wasn't //really// being cut off. They didn't meet, didn't talk that much. But they still talked occasionally. Still were friendly. Just... strained.\n\n\n\nAnd Andy didn't want that. They really, really did not want that. Despite everything, despite all of the stress, Andy did not want to lose their mother early. They really didn't.\n\n\n\nThey stood and entered the house, letting the warmth inside melt away any cool temperatures they had been in.\n\n\n\nAnd the house was just as cold.\n\n\n\nUp the stairs they went, entering their room and seeing their curtain-less window.\n\n\n\nThey stopped in front of the window, staring out of it once more.\n\n\n\nThen they opened the window.\n\n\n\nAndy didn't know where to start. They were afraid. If it wasn't real, it would have already fallen apart. At any point over the months where Andy tried to prevent it.\n\n\n\nEven then, they tried to rationalize their fear. That it wouldn't be all too bad. But, they knew it would be hard going forward. They knew that there was a good chance they'd be beaten down at any turn. They knew that throughout the rest of their life, they'd fight an uphill battle that they could likely never win.\n\n\n\nAnd Andy accepted that. They would have to be ready to face it one day. Mayble not day one, but they had to get ready to face what would happen if such a truth were ever revealed.\n\n\n\nShe closed the window, left the curtain open, and walked to bed.\n\n\n\nTucked into the sheets, she let her eyes close, and drifted off to sleep.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n||~ Flight ||~ Date ||~ Origin ||~ Destination ||~ Seat||\n\n|| 202 || 27/DEC/2023 || Pittsburgh, PA || Denver, CO || 3C ||\n\n\n\n**Departure:** 06:30\n\n\n\n**Passenger Name:** Andy Clarke\n\n\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n\n\nDecember 31,\n\n2023\n\n\n\n23:36\n\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nShe stared into the mirror. She had been staring into it for a few minutes. It dawned on Andy's mind that she hadn't shaved ever since she had gotten back from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\nWhatever little hair she had on her head, she pulled back and tucked behind her ears. Shaving cream lathered her face and she grabbed a razor, using it with precision to cut every single strand of hair off of her face.\n\n\n\n//Yet she hated how gritty her face felt as she rubbed her hands against it.//\n\n\n\nSo she shaved it again.\n\n\n\nAnd a third time.\n\n\n\nUntil it felt /just a little bit// smoother.\n\n\n\nAnd that was all she felt she could do. When she moved to clean up, she saw her arms.\n\n\n\nHer hairy, horrendous arms.\n\n\n\nThe sleeves on her arms were pulled up until they resembled a tank top. She slathered her left arm with shaving cream, then pressed her razor against it.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nShe was done. Both arms. Where they were hairy and irritating, now they felt smooth. She had to put toilet paper on the spots of her arms where she nicked herself\n\n\n\nThe couch cushioned her fall as she leaned back against it. Her roommate had gone to party, as most people likely had. But she decided to stay home.\n\n\n\nHer laptop opened, and she began to play //The Thing//.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n----\n\nDecember 31,\n\n2023\n\n\n\n23:55\n\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nAndy took out her phone.

I guess I put together the nail polish and the mascara; thought that it was for you. That there was some part of you that you were hiding. And I wanted to support you if you were hiding it.

I don't think it is right for me to be a man anymore.\n\n\n\n**Quint:** Do you think you're trans? Or non-binary?\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I don't know. I would feel better - or at least think I would feel better - if I was a woman. But I don't think I'll ever come close to that, truly. So I don't know what I am realistically going to be, or are realistically.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n**Andy:** I'm sorry for lashing out. I still- stand by what I said. Well, some of it. I'm still mad that you looked at my stuff when I was drunk. But, I think that I lashed out for the wrong reason. I was just... angry, I guess?

Checking her makeup, it dawned on her that whatever little makeup she had on was rushed and shoddy.\n\n\n\nMuch like before, her lipstick veered away from the track of her lips, her eyeliner was shaky, and she could easily point out how different the blush was to her skin color. Hell, even her nails seemed off. She felt them, noticing bumps and uneven application.\n\n\n\nTwo whole hours had been spent to apply the makeup just to make it look presentable. Not good, not decent, but presentable!\n\n\n\nAll so she could make a thirty-one-second walk to Quint's house and not be noticed.\n\n\n\nIt was in vain, a stupid idea. She slammed her head back against her seat.\n\n\n\nThe longer she stayed in the car the more likely it would be for more people to notice.\n\n\n\nShe left and practically ran to Quint's door.\n\n\n\nHer clothes didn't match, either. Black cargo pants, a white long-sleeved undershirt, and a green branded t-shirt. They didn't match with her makeup. Anybody would instantly think that she was a boy pretending to be-\n\n\n\nShe arrived at the door. Time slowed, every movement became heavy. Every breath she took was forced. A knock barely left her hand before she froze, feeling minutes pass.\n\n\n\nThen the door opened.\n\n\n\nQuing lunged at Andy with a hug.\n\n\n\n\"Hey Andy! How was the trip.\"\n\n\n\nThrough the pressure on her lungs, she spoke.\n\n\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\n\n\"I like your makeup.\"\n\n\n\nAll of the pressure, all at once, faded.\n\n\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\n\n\"How much do you have to unpack?\"\n\n\n\n\"A bit.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, let's go, then.\"\n\n\n\nThe duo spent three hours to empty Andy's car and make trips to Andy's old apartment.\n\n\n\nIt took two trips back to Andy's apartment to get everything.\n\n\n\nThe last item the pair got was a Dutch oven. Andy had contemplated not bringing it, to just leave it behind. But they knew they had to keep it.\n\n\n\nShe left the car and slowly carried the Dutch oven. She had to keep a slower pace to avoid dropping it. After two minutes, she arrived at her apartment door and brought the Dutch oven in with her.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nAndy awoke. She turned over, and grabbed her phone. She checked the time.\n\n\n\n//April 7, 4:37 A.M.//\n\n\n\nShe leaned back against her pillow. Her alarm wasn't supposed to go off until eight. Andy closed her eyes, trying to go back to sleep. After eleven minutes, she opened her eyes.\n\n\n\nAndy rolled out of her bed. She stretched, letting out a yawn as she grabbed a glass on her nightstand. She drank out of it, quickly finding it empty. Andy began to hobble to the kitchen.\n\n\n\nAndy took out her ice tray. She popped out three ice cubes, plopping them in the glass. She then went to the sink and filled her cup with tap water.\n\n\n\nAndy took out her phone.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++ Mom\n\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n> I got a new apartment\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n> ?\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\n\n> with quint\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n> When was this?\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\n\n> yesterday\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n> Why didn't you tell me about this?\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\n\n> it was about the same as my current rent. a bit less, actually\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n> Okay.

All from her mom, all angry. Some telling her off for having cussed. Some for being ungrateful. Some for not talking to her anymore. Some saying that Andy hated her. Some which claimed that Andy never wanted to visit.\n\n\n\nAnd then there was one question to top it all off.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++++ Mom\n\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[<]]\n\n> Do you even really love me?\n\n[[/<]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nShe didn't respond to it.

She stretched out her hand, moving aside the vines of all three of her Golden Pothos plants.\n\n\n\nThe sun began to set. An orange hue sprayed with magenta was overtaking the Rocky Mountain skyline.

She gathered everything she could.\n\n\n\nAnd then, Andie began to experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n----\n\n++++ Potato Leek Soup\n\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n+++ Ingredients:\n\n\n\n* Loaf of Sourdough Bread\n\n* 6 oz of Salami\n\n* 6 Leeks\n\n* 6 Potatoes\n\n* Chicken Broth/Stock\n\n* 1 Cup of Cream\n\n* 4 Cloves of Garlic\n\n* Pepper\n\n* Garlic Powder\n\n* Onion Powder\n\n* Cayenne Powder\n\n* MSG\n\n* Celery Salt\n\n* Salt\n\n* Brown Sugar\n\n* 2 Bay Leaves\n\n* 1 Sprig of Rosemary\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n+++ Tools:\n\n\n\n* Dutch Oven/Soup Pot\n\n* Spatula\n\n* Ladle\n\n* Cutting Board\n\n* Knife\n\n* Mixing Bowl\n\n* Immersion Blender\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n+++ Preparation:\n\n\n\nPlace your cold pot on your stovetop. Do not turn on the heat.\n\n\n\nTake the salami and cut into chunks. Peel and dice all six of your garlic cloves. Make sure that you have at least six cups of chicken broth/stock available, although have more ready if you can.\n\n\n\nSlice off the root of your leeks. Then, cut your leeks once length-wise down the middle. Chop all of your leeks from the whites up until the greek stalks become dry. Place all of the chopped leeks in the mixing bowl, and bring them to the sink. Begin to fill the bowl with water as you use your hands to massage the chopped leeks, doing so to remove all of the dirt and sediment. Fill up to the top of the bowl with water. The leeks should float at the top of your bowl.\n\n\n\n(Optionally peel your potatoes). Wash off your potatoes thoroughly to remove dirt and excess starch. Chop into small chunks.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n+++ Cooking:\n\n\n\nIn your cold pot, place all of your diced salami. Make sure that there is no water or oil in the pot. Turn the temperature up to medium-high (As the temperature of the pot increases, fat will render out of the salami. This should produce enough fat to dually cook the salami and all other ingredients you need to fry before putting in stock. Any other fatty meat would work as a substitute.). Let simmer for 2 - 5 minutes, until a thin layer of fat covers the pot. Begin stirring salami after one minute.\n\n\n\nAfter roughly a minute, add in your garlic. Let simmer for a further minute before removing the leeks from your bowl and place them into the pot (As said before, all of the leeks should float. Try to minimize the amount of water going into the pot. While some water is inevitable, putting in too much water with the leek will prevent the leeks from frying.).\n\n\n\n**DO NOT** pour remaining water in the bowl down your sink. There should be visible amounts of sand and debris that sink down to the bottom of your bowl, which may be harmful for your drainage. The water is great to use for watering your plants. If not, simply pour the water outside.\n\n\n\nStir frequently and let simmer for around three more minutes. After the time has passed, add in your potatoes. Stir roughly twice a minute for three minutes. (Cooking the potatoes and leeks ahead of boiling them helps the entire dish cook faster, as well as giving them browning and flavor.)\n\n\n\nWhen the potatoes are done simmering, add in enough chicken broth/stock. If you like thicker soups, make sure to add enough stock to just //barely// cover the other ingredients. If you like lighter soups, add in enough stock to cover the ingredients by one or two inches.\n\n\n\nWith the stock in, turn the temperature up to high. While the soup begins to boil, add in both bay leaves and a tablespoon of brown sugar (Brown sugar makes every recipe taste better). Frequently stir and scrape the bottom of the pot to avoid burning.\n\n\n\nOnce the soup has reached a boil, reduce the heat to low/medium-low and stir until the soup is reduced to a simmer. Let simmer for 15 - 30 minutes. Check your potatoes every 2 - 3 minutes starting at around ten minutes. Once your potatoes are easily piercable with a fork, they are ready.\n\n\n\nAdd in your seasonings. You can choose different seasonings depending on your personal taste preferences. If you choose to add both salt and celery salt, make sure to minimize the amount of standard salt you apply accordingly to how much celery salt you put in (I personally only put half as much salt in as I do celery salt).\n\n\n\nUse your spatula to fish out both bay leaves. Add in your cup of cream. Add more or less cream depending on your desired coloration. No matter how much you add, let your cream simmer for a few minutes until it separates and a thin layer forms on the soup. This should also be accompanied by the soup thickening.\n\n\n\nTurn off your heat and take out your immersion blender. Puree the soup to your desired consistency.\n\n\n\nAfter you are done pureeing, add in your rosemary.\n\n\n\nServe the soup in a bowl with a side of sourdough bread. Rip off chunks of the sourdough and dip in the soup to eat.\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n- Andie Clarke\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["bittersweet", "forgotten-memories", "lgbtq", "slice-of-life", "tale"], "title": "Potato Leek Soup - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/potato-leek-soup", "year": 2025}, "silver-hair-and-silver-tongues": {"created_at": "2025-01-05T22:50:00", "creator": "Ralliston", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Ralliston", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ralliston", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-05T22:50:00"}, {"author": "Ralliston", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ralliston", "comment": "Added tags: art-exchange.

Personnel handling SCP-XXXX are to notify the SCP-XXXX project lead, <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Senior Researcher Luca Armaros</span> Dr. Lilllian Lillihammer.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-XXXX is a leather-bound tome attributed in authorship to Johan Huizinga, a Dutch historian and linguist, as well as <a href=\"/parker-informational-breach\">suspected thaumaturge</a> and hermeneuticist. Its cover is bereft of any illustrations, save for the author's name and the title, which reads \"Sprookjes\" (<em>Fairy Tales</em> in Dutch).</p>\n<p>SCP-XXXX's content matches the expectation given by its title; the 159-page tome is filled with illustrated Dutch fairy tales,<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> all of which had been hand-written using ink.

Upon coming into visual contact with it, the person interacting with the object will promptly cease to understand any languages other than Dutch (even if, before, they had no skills in Dutch at all). For the next two hours, the affected individual will be incapable of thinking, writing, and reading in any language but Dutch. After the two hour mark, the effect will cease, and the subject's linguistic skills will be returned to their basic state. The effects will remanifest upon further contact with SCP-XXXX.</p>\n<p>SCP-XXXX was recovered during a raid on a <em>giftschreiber</em><sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> outpost carried out by Mobile Task Force Rho-43 (\"Home Invaders\"), led by Dr. Lillian Lillihammer on 27/08/2024. Although the book bears no obvious markings identifying it as a <em>giftschreiber</em> artifact, it was nevertheless stored on-site alongside several other tomes of memetic nature, suggesting a connection between the object, its author, and the Group of Interest.</p>\n<p>Further investigation into its properties as well as into the nature of its author is ongoing.</p>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>\"Hmm.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmm?\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>Hrmm</em>,\" repeated Lillian Lillihammer, standing up and scratching her chin. \"Yeah, this isn't going to work.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"/scp-8166\">Luca Armaros</a> blinked twice, looking away from the tome in front of him and up, towards Lillian's towering figure. \"What? Why not?\"</p>\n<p>\"Because I <em>already know Dutch</em>, so it's as good as useless on me,\" she said, pacing around the table. Before he could ask, she added: \"You pick it up after one too many days with Ilse.\"</p>\n<p>He corrected his half-moon glasses. \"Hold on, Lillian\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"That's <em>doctor</em> Lillihammer.\"</p>\n<p>\"Apologies, <em>Doctor</em> Lillihammer. Heather told me you were the best of the best. That if anyone could make sense of it, you could. Am I to understand that she was wrong?\"</p>\n<p>She rolled her eyes, but vaguely smirked at the mention of her fianc\u00e9e's name. It wasn't that she wasn't good enough to help Armaros; it was that this was an anomaly that simple to be worth her time. In a schedule as tight as hers \u2014 and as packed with saving the world from memetic doomsday cults \u2014 she didn't care to lose time with low-stakes drivel such as this. Not even as a break from her actually important work.</p>\n<p>\u2026But on the other hand, Heather had asked her to help Luca out.</p>\n<p>She had asked her very, very nicely.</p>\n<p>There weren't many people Lillian could tolerate \u2014 there were even less whose company she actively enjoyed. Heather Garrison, however, was as close as people could get to the latter category without quite literally being Lillian Lillihammer. She'd give her life to protect that woman, so she supposed that a week of her time wasn't too outrageous of an alternative. Besides: she knew Heather and Armaros went <a href=\"/the-legend-of-the-iron-goat\">way back</a>. He might have been a dork of the more pathetic sort, but <em>he</em> was the one who saw something more in Heather than the glorified paper-pusher the Foundation's bureaucratic machine had appointed her as. He was the one who made her see the potential she had \u2014 the potential which, inevitably, brought her to Lillihammer's side.</p>\n<p>\"Ugh. Fine,\" she said, rubbing her eyes. \"But don't expect miracles, archivist.\" She pointed her long finger directly in-between Luca's eyes. \"I don't have the time to perform them for you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, I really\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, yes, save your platitudes for when I'm done. In the meantime,\" she said, throwing Luca a folder with the relevant documentation. He caught it, but only barely. \"Make yourself useful.\"</p>\n<p>He raised an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\"Huizinga isn't going to figure himself out himself. I need to know if the man was a <em>giftschreiber</em> or just a nerd.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, all of my material is back at Site\u2014\"</p>\n<p>She waved her hand. \"That won't be necessary. I've already told a local friend of mine he'll be helping you. He knows his books, trust you me. Especially those whose words have been Poisoned.\" She turned towards the nearest file cabinet, already starting to browse through the gathered documents. \"I'll send you a meme-free scan when I get the chance.\"</p>\n<p>\"I\u2026 I'm not sure if I'd be the greatest research partner? I, uh, like to talk a lot during\u2014\"</p>\n<p>She turned back, eyed him up and down, then raised an eyebrow. \"Harry hasn't had a single good thing to do since he's gotten married. Besides,\" she said, smirking, and shifting her attention once more towards something else. \"With how much nonsense you both talk, I'm sure you two will get along just <em>swimmingly</em>.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[\ud83d\udf02]</p>\n<p>Luca had been to Site-43 a few times before, in the long years that had passed since he'd first crossed paths with Heather.</p>\n<p>Still: he never did get used to the layout.</p>\n<p>All of his trips had been nothing but momentary transfers, more aimed at catching up with an old friend than actual scientific progress. In a field as seemingly insignificant to the Foundation's mission at large as his, the occasional tour was a privilege he could afford, but one he nevertheless remained ambivalent towards. Sure, actually talking with Heather was better than the occasional text they'd still send each other, but the facility was\u2026 well. Even for his standards, it was <em>weird</em>.</p>\n<p>It was practically a tomb, with how deep it had been constructed; a tomb filled with esoteric waste and more esoteric legacies still. Its long, white corridors came together to form quite the labyrinth \u2014 one that Luca had trouble navigating even with the three subway lines connecting it together. The people, too, were far from the Foundation baseline he'd come to expect. Given his own condition, he recognized the irony of that thought, of course, but there were only so many janitors with personal mirror monsters or time-stuck researchers he could meet before starting to question his own sanity.</p>\n<p>Still: when he had gotten the message some week ago that Sophia was briefly transferring him back to this place, he welcomed it as a good change of pace. Of course, it was nothing compared to the change of pace he had felt a few days prior when the apparently hermeneutic artifact he had been sent briefly turned him into a citizen of Utrecht in all but name, but it was at least something.</p>\n<p><em>Maybe here they'll take my work as more than a curiosity</em>, he thought as he came to a sudden stop.</p>\n<p>It took him nearly an hour of wandering through old abatement facilities and jam-packed common rooms, but he finally made it to his destination.</p>\n<p>The lettering upon the heavy door in front of him simply read:</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h3 id=\"toc0\"><span>Dr. Harold R. Blank</span></h3>\n<h5 id=\"toc1\"><span>Archives and Revision, Chair</span></h5>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Well. That was that, then.</p>\n<p>He took a deep breath, cleared his throat, and \u2014 having knocked, as nothing but a courtesy \u2014 walked through.</p>\n<p>If he had considered Site-43 a tomb before, what lay before him had to be at least a mausoleum.</p>\n<p>It was a pretentious space, in the way that the offices of all intellectuals were. Unlike all of its other brethren, however, this one had a heart. Perhaps too much, in some parts, but the owner's character nevertheless permeated through the place like an ambient spiritual energy. From the neatly-organized Pink Floyd CD collection to a frighteningly long bookshelf containing all of Tolkien's (both senior and junior) written work, it was a lot. It was a lot, but it certainly spoke to Luca's heart. The image of the man who owned this office was completed by two things: a photo of an older, smiling woman standing in a park next to a similar but younger woman, framed neatly next to the laptop on top of the desk, and the man himself, his long-haired silhouette only barely sticking out of the stacks of books and paper all around him.</p>\n<p>All things considered, Luca thought, the place fit him well. He cleared his throat again. This time, the man did react; he first slowly poked his silver head up, blinked twice, corrected his glasses, and then smiled politely.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, yes, yes, hello,\" he said, quickly standing up. \"I see you managed to find your way down to my sanctuary.\"</p>\n<p>Yes, Luca had to admit, the place did look maybe one step removed from a hermitage. \"Yeah. Glad, uh, glad I could make it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Indeed.\" The man extended his hand. \"Harry, as I'm sure you've noticed on your way in. Nice to meet you\u2026 Luca, I presume?\"</p>\n<p>\"Luca Armaros, yes,\" he said, shaking Harry's hand. \"The pleasure is all mine.\"</p>\n<p>\"Lil told me to expect you. Not that I expected you so soon, but\u2026\" He waved his hand. \"Well. I wasn't being of much use anyway.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, I did consider whether I should come later, since maybe you could still be asleep, and\u2014\"</p>\n<p>Harry smiled, and sat back down on his chair. \"Don't worry. You couldn't have woken me up. That's not a possibility I've even tried to manifest tonight. Do make yourself comfortable \u2014 as comfortable as you can get in here, anyway,\" he said, pointing towards the nearest chair. \"I don't think we'll achieve much standing.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, yes, yes, right,\" Luca mumbled out, and sat down. \"Of course\"</p>\n<p>He looked at Harry. As if on command, both corrected their glasses.</p>\n<p>\"So,\" Harry said, clapping his hands. \"How exactly can I help you?\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[\ud83d\udf02]</p>\n<p>\"How do you think it's layered?\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>Wat?</em>\"</p>\n<p><em>Oh. Right.</em> Lillihammer adjusted herself mentally, cleared her throat, and continued in the appropriate language: \"<em>Hoe denk je dat het opgebouwd is?</em>\" she asked, carefully looking at the pages laying in front of her.</p>\n<p>From a certain angle, the letters almost seemed to glow. This was certainly by design; the room around them \u2014 her own personal office, a hermetic memetic exclusion zone created from scratch and filled with preventive measures the likes of which the world had never before seen \u2014 was constructed in such a way so as to highlight any foreign glyphs present inside. Still: the almost ephemeral glow was not what Lillian had expected. She'd thought this would be some simple <em>giftschreiber</em> trick, a proof-of-concept of a real end product aimed at causing actual chaos. But this? This fit none of the patterns she could ever remember seeing, and she trusted her memory more than herself.</p>\n<p>\"<em>It's definitely not the baseline eye-mind connection, that's for sure,</em>\" Heather said, putting another page of the manuscript against the giant printer. \"<em>It's strange.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmm.\"</p>\n<p>Lillian leaned closer towards the tome, and narrowed her eyes.</p>\n<p>\"<em>This is nonsense. Utter nonsense.</em>\"</p>\n<p>Heather raised an eyebrow, but otherwise remained silently by her post, scanning the tome one <em>beep</em> after another.</p>\n<p>As she always did when not uninterrupted \u2014 and, more often than not, <em>especially</em> when interrupted \u2014 Lillian continued. \"<em>It doesn't anchor itself to anything specific. It shouldn't work.</em>\" She threw her hand in the air. \"<em>It's just\u2026 an image, bound to no specific reaction. The fact that it actually instills any reaction is bullshit. It <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shouldn't</span></em>.\"</p>\n<p>Heather considered. \"<em>What if it's not meant to?</em>\"</p>\n<p>Lillian actually blinked. \"<em>What?</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>You're looking at it as if it was one of your kill agents, Lils.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>It's very clearly a similar mechanism. One look at it and you're fucked.</em>\" She paused. \"<em>It's just that this one doesn't kill you, just makes you Dutch. Which, to be fair, close enough, but\u2014</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>Lils.</em>\" Heather said, coming closer towards Lillian. She put a hand on her shoulder. <em>\"You're thinking about it as if it was a weapon. Why?</em>\"</p>\n<p>She shrugged. \"<em>Because what the hell would you use this for, if not as a weapon? Some bullshit chaos tool the German nutcases wanted to use to spread Dutch into the rest of the adjacent languages, like what <a href=\"/scp-5382\">Thilo's already once done</a>.</em>\" She sighed. \"<em>My point is this: why make something like this if not for war?</em>\"</p>\n<p>Heather smiled. \"<em>That <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">is</span> the right question, isn't it?</em>\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[\ud83d\udf02]</p>\n<p>\"So, Huizinga, huh?\" Harry said, narrowing his eyes, Even from behind his thick frames, Luca could see him scan one line of database tables after another. \"Huizinga\u2026 Huizinga\u2026\"</p>\n<p>Harry frowned \u2014 more so than his usual, baseline expression \u2014 and scratched his head. \"We've got a Huith, Huir, and Huitz in this thing, but no Huizinga.\" He popped his lips. \"Huh.\"</p>\n<p>For a few moments, he remained still.</p>\n<p>\"So what, that's it?\" Luca said, the slightest tint of disheartment present in his tone. \"The line just ends here?\"</p>\n<p>\"Far worse.\" Harry looked him in the eyes. \"It leads to the physical archives.\"</p>\n<p>With a heavy grunt, the historian stood up, and moved a few boxes, revealing the second part of his study: the place where all hopes and dreams died, or the bookshelves upon bookshelves of non-digitized documents belonging to the History Department. Originally, the job of actually getting them into the database proper had been assigned to junior researchers here at Forty-Three, but, well; after the last occupant of that particular slave labor had been blown to cross-dimensional and cross-deific bits by the Site's <a href=\"/scp-5243\">annual cascade of cross-temporal bullshit</a>, Harry hadn't had the heart to sentence anyone else to that fate.</p>\n<p>That had been more than a decade ago; the documents, naturally, never did stop coming.</p>\n<p>With the kind of gesture reserved for death row inmates, Harry signalled Luca to come closer. He obeyed, and after a moment found himself among an archive so large and expansive it pulled the breath out of his lungs. When he did take the next breath, however, he was smiling, much to Harry's dismay.</p>\n<p>Had he no job to do other than this assignment, Luca would have loved to do nothing but sort all of these papers and books. It was clear that nobody else was going to do it \u2014 <em>obviously</em> \u2014 but Luca could. It spoke to some particularly solitary part of his personality, seeing all of those countless documents just <em>waiting</em> to be cataloged and organized. He was, of course, still a man, but somewhere in his soul he was primarily an archivist, one who would love to see all of this made into a coherent whole.</p>\n<p>Judging by Harry's reaction, even their shared job and position could not help with crossing that particular bridge between their experiences.</p>\n<p>\"Well,\" he said, smiling slightly, \"I'm glad you don't see this place as the execution wall I've come to dread it as. Because we're going to spend a <em>long time here</em>,\" he added, crossing his arms and glancing at the heavy tonnes of paper under the section marked with a large, bolded 'H'.</p>\n<p>\"Better get started, then.\"</p>\n<p>Harry shrugged. \"Tomorrow's already caught me down here, so I do suppose I've got nothing to lose.\"</p>\n<p>Slowly, and with the kind of precision and worry mostly reserved for handling wild animals, Harry took the nearest ladder and stacked it up against the shelf in front of them. Before he could show Luca that he was free to climb first, Armaros was already halfway up.</p>\n<p>\"Hmm. <em>Hmm</em>.\" He grunted, slowly starting to rummage through piles upon piles of cross-referencial reports handling topics of no real interest to anyone but maybe Maria Jones herself. After a while that felt longer to Harry than it did to him, he eventually said, \"I think I've got something.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah?\"</p>\n<p>Luca narrowed his eyes through his glasses. \"It's\u2026 not quite a dossier, but it's <em>something</em>. Some\u2026 Some list of paranormal-adjacent linguists, I think, and\u2026\"</p>\n<p>He reached out towards one level higher, shifting his weight to the front of his body. \"\u2026and he's here! He's\u2014\"</p>\n<p>Suddenly, and without any fault of his own, he felt the ladder slip from under his feet. Seeing how the only things he could grab onto were the shelf itself and the books inside it, he didn't have enough actual leverage to avoid the fall. Before he could think of anything else to do \u2014 or indeed react to this at all, in the fraction of a second his mind had been given to process the fact that was about to transpire \u2014 he surrendered to gravity, taking with him some ten kilos of yellow paper nobody except him had seen since they had been printed.</p>\n<p>Somewhere in-between all of that, he managed to half-swear, \"Pancakes!\" before he landed on the solid floor with a heavy thud, burying himself under a self-made blanket of pages.</p>\n<p>Without hesitation, Harry reached out, taking off the first layer.</p>\n<p>Beneath it, Luca lay in a fetal position, his body covered by one more veneer: one made from his own four blue wings, sprouting from his back, now no longer hidden under his Foundation-issued uniform. No scratches or bruised blemished his body \u2014 the power that had sprouted his new appendages so many years ago made sure that no harm came to him from sources as mundane as this.</p>\n<p>When Luca opened his eyes again, the spark from previously had disappeared \u2014 in their place there now was worry.</p>\n<p>In his long years working here, Harry had seen that brand of fear many, many times. He knew what it meant more so than he wished he did.</p>\n<p>\"I\u2026 I'm sorry,\" Luca said, slowly standing up, his head down. \"I didn't\u2026\" he trailed off, avoiding eye contact. His wings were low, now, clutched close to his back.</p>\n<p>\"Luca,\" Harry said, taking a deep breath. He had gone through this dance many times before, considering his place of employment. He could never relate, of course \u2014 not fully \u2014 but he did get how to get it. \"Come on. Nothing to apologize for.\"</p>\n<p>The other archivist remained unconvinced. He'd heard this part many times before, too. He's long since forgiven himself for allowing himself to get trickd into becoming the Guardian, but it still wasn't the part of himself he wanted others to see first. He didn't want them to think of him as a monster, as some fool he was presented as during Site-19 lectures. He preferred to lay low, whenever he got the chance. It wasn't shame; more-so as a silent worry. Not of the possibility of bodily harm (his mantle of Guardian took care of that, mostly), but of what others could do to people like him, if they couldn't see past his first impression.</p>\n<p>He almost-whispered, \"I don't want to\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Listen.\" Harry looked him square in the eyes. \"My best friend is the student of an immortal Austrian wizard. My <em>second</em> best friend is bad luck incarnate. I once dated an <em>actual witch</em>. I don't care about any of that, Luca. I don't care what others might think of you. None of that defines you. What I see in front of me is a man dedicated to his job and passion. One whose help I need to do this.</p>\n<p>\"My point is this: I don't care, and neither should you.\"</p>\n<p>Luca stayed silent.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026Because we've still got an actual metric ton of documents to go through.\" He smiled, now, the gesture warm and honest. \"You don't think I'd let you leave before we finished this, did you? I know our words come alive here at Forty-Three far more often than in other parts of the Foundation, but even here, the cases don't solve themselves, Mr. Archivist. So get back here and let's get this thing sorted, eh?</p>\n<p>Luca didn't say anything, for a very long second.</p>\n<p>Then, he smiled back.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[\ud83d\udf02]</p>\n<p>She scratched her chin, for what was possibly the millionth time this evening. She was beginning to ponder if she had a nervous tick. \"<em>I do wonder,</em>\" Lillian said, coming closer to Heather and leaning over the book.</p>\n<p>Heather chuckled. \"<em>You always do, Lils. What about, this time?</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>How this exactly works, without a trigger.</em>\"</p>\n<p>The other memeticist rolled her eyes. \"<em>Yes, we've already gone over that. We\u2014</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>No, I mean actually. Like,</em>\" she said, stabbing one of the pages with her finger. <em>\"None of the signs indicate any coercion. It's just\u2026 a soup of memetic symbols, none of them particularly bound together into a single formula.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>Wait</em>,\" Heather said, smiling, \"d<em>id you just admit that you don't know the answer, babe?</em>\"</p>\n<p>Lillian groaned. She did not like not knowing things. \"<em>It doesn't add up. It shouldn't just do nothing because it's got no target \u2014 it should do nothing because it <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">does not</span> do anything.</em>\"</p>\n<p>For a moment, Heather considered, carrying over the last copied pages onto the binding machine. \"<em>Well, I think it's all just about perspective, really.</em>\"</p>\n<p>Lillian raised an eyebrow. \"<em>What?</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>If it's not an immediate effect, maybe it's something slower. Something more gradual, perhaps, not so immediate \u2014 something far more subtle. Something not intrusive.</em>\" She paused. <em>\"Who do you think Huizinga was, really? Beneath all of that work we're analyzing.</em>\"</p>\n<p>The eyebrow now turned into an arch. \"<em>That's\u2026 what Harry and Armaros are trying to figure out.</em>\"</p>\n<p>Heather shook her head. \"<em>I don't mean what he was. What he worked as, or what group he possibly aligned himself with,</em>\" she said. \"<em>I'm asking who he was <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">really</span>, beneath all of those titles. I'm sure you can remember something.</em>\"</p>\n<p>After a second of searching, Lillian found that Heather indeed was right. There <em>was</em> something about Huizinga in that perfect memory of hers that she could salvage. She decided to indulge her. \"<em>An historian, primarily. Also a linguist. Travelled a lot.</em>\" She paused. <em>\"So someone who cared about the world, in its entirety. Tried to care, anyway. Tried to see the bigger picture.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>Yeah. So <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">why</span> would he make this?</em>\"</p>\n<p>Lillian groaned. \"<em>That's the whole\u2014</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>No, Lils. Stop being stupid, Why do you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">think</span> he would make it? I don't care about truth, I want your opinion. Why do you think someone like him would make a memetic tool \u2014 one that doesn't have an aggressive effect and is tied to a single, unassuming object? One that can bring no harm to anyone? One bound to a book, out of all things?</em>\"</p>\n<p>Normally, there were two things Lillian despised, more than anything else \u2014 being interrupted, and being lectured. Heather, however, was anything but normal; she was one of the few people that could match her speed (and her interest). Though Lillian possessed a proficiency in pretty much all subjects she wished to possess a proficiency in, one thing she never could figure out fully was how normal people thought. She could predict them, better so than almost anyone else alive, and she could manipulate them to her own ends \u2014 but getting to see down-to-earth things through their eyes was something else entirely. It didn't escape her \u2014 it just actively bored her.</p>\n<p>Heather, however, always could see the grander picture, especially when it came to memetics.</p>\n<p>It was her job, after all.</p>\n<p>Lillian considered. She looked down at the book. The <em>book</em>. Oh. \"<em>To make them do something, but of their own volition. Not to force them, but to point to some direction \u2014 show them the path towards noticing something. Just like a book.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>Just like a book, yeah. And where does that lead us? If not to the mind, like you already established, then where?</em>\" She came closer, and put her hand on Lillian's. Very slowly, she navigated both towards one of the symbols written on the page. \"<em>And don't say that it was to make people learn Dutch. Who would actually want that?</em>\"</p>\n<p>Lillian blinked twice.</p>\n<p>Then, she got it.</p>\n<p>\"<em>To the heart. Whatever it is, the message leads right to your heart.\"</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[\ud83d\udf02]</p>\n<p>Luca had thought it'd be an easy job, all things considered.</p>\n<p>His optimism did not waver when faced with the archives; it didn't even waver when he realized they were going to have to compile a timeline.</p>\n<p>But when, by the five hour mark, they'd barely scratched the surface of the iceberg, he <em>was</em> beginning to question whether this was a one day job.</p>\n<p>Harry sighed, rubbed his eyes, and turned over another page of some manuscript older than them both (which, considering both were technically semi-immortal, was quite the achievement). He noted something down, propped his head up, and went back to reading.</p>\n<p>After a while, he turned to face Luca. \"You got anything?\"</p>\n<p>Luca popped his lips. \"Nothing new. Nothing new that's <em>exciting</em>, I guess I should say.\" He blinked twice, already feeling the exhaustion from all the work starting to creep in. \"If I have to read about one more historical summit\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah.\" Harry put the book aside. \"Yeah. Too much even for me.\" Just like any real historian, Harry did have an admiration for the great work that Huizinga's contributions had carried over to his field of study. But, after as long as this \u2014 and as late as this \u2014 his admiration even for a man like him started to turn into ennui. He looked at the tome for some few seconds, then diverted his sight back towards Luca. \"This clearly isn't working,\" he said, picking up his notes.</p>\n<p>Luca raised an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\"We've got a timeline of his life and major cross-references, but none of it is of any actual use.\"</p>\n<p>Luca put up his finger, trying in a positive tone, \"Maybe sometimes absence of evidence <em>is</em> evidence of ab\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Right, yes, yes, but we can't be <em>sure</em> because there's nothing concrete in this goddamn thing. No lines to draw immediate conclusion through.\" He sighed. \"I was built for reading, not for\u2026 this nonsense vague intention analysis. Half a degree in literature does not an English teacher make,\" he said, a bitter chuckle entering his lips.</p>\n<p>Yes, half a degree in literature studies barely made someone an expert; but a full one did. Luca <em>was</em> built for this exact thing. He smiled very slowly. \"I think we ought to step back and look at what we've got.\"</p>\n<p>Harry gave him a look. \"And what <em>do</em> we've got?\"</p>\n<p>\"Time to find out, no?\" he said, standing up.</p>\n<p>Harry grunted, but soon followed Luca's stead.</p>\n<p>Before long, they were looking at a lot of very badly handwritten post-it notes, all assembled together into a grotesque imitation of a mosaic.</p>\n<p>\"Like I said: there's not much here,\" Harry said, unconvinced. \"Unless you really want to read about tea parties.\"</p>\n<p>Luca nodded. \"Right. But it does paint us a picture of him, doesn't it?\"</p>\n<p>\"I suppose so.\" Harry considered. \"What are you looking for, exactly?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm trying to see what kind of man arises as an image from this all. What general outlines we can trace to who he was.\"</p>\n<p>That got Harry's attention. \"Well. He wasn't a shit, for starters. Rare in those times.\" He pointed to one of the notes. \"He opposed the Nazis pretty heavily back in the thirtees.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you think a <em>giftschreiber</em> would do that? Try to avoid the chaos and suffering that followed?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, no, but I don't want to cross him out on the basis of one claim. Just one source isn't going to cut it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Right.\" Luca paused, pondering.</p>\n<p>Harry said, \"It's also clear he wasn't narrow-minded. Tried to not be, in any case.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, the travel log's rather impressive. As are his linguistics,\" he added, snapping his fingers at some table of data. \"Sanskrit and German aren't too bad for a man of his times.\"</p>\n<p>Harry nodded. He was fully in lecture mode, now. He was starting to enjoy this. \"With the exception of <em>The Autumn</em>, he's also written a few things on culture. <em>Also</em> shockingly progressive and open-minded. Cared about art and the human spirit.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmm.\"</p>\n<p>Harry sighed, one more time. \"All right, I yield. This is no <em>giftschreiber</em> profile. Not unless he was absurdly covert. Which,\" he said, \"for the sake of our own sanity, I won't for now consider.</p>\n<p>\"However,\" he continued, unwilling to surrender his point, \"just because he wasn't this particular brand of memetic cultist doesn't mean he wasn't one of some other.\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course. But he definitely wasn't one of the apocalypse-harbinging ones, on that we can agree.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes.\" Harry scratched his nose. \"For what it's worth, the man genuinely did seem to care about the artistic and cultural legacy of humanity, enough to try to protect it.\" He waved his hand. \"The non-fascist read on legacy, I mean.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. It's clear he found great value in what he studied.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mhm.\"</p>\n<p>\"So what <em>was</em> his work doing in a <em>giftschreiber</em> stash? If it wasn't written by one of theirs, what use is it to them?\"</p>\n<p>Harry considered. \"Maybe as a contrast. An instruction, what not to do.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hardly his best work for that particular lesson.\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>If</em> the lesson they got from it is the one we are also assuming, that is.\"</p>\n<p>Luca skewed his head. \"What do you mean?\"</p>\n<p>\"What if it isn't just about the obvious plurality of human culture, from an academic standpoint?\"</p>\n<p>\"Are you proposing a more\u2026 down to earth read?\"</p>\n<p>Harry nodded. \"It <em>is</em> a fairytale book, after all. Hardly the most serious of sources for academia,\" he said. \"But yes. What if it isn't some serious message about the inner workings of a human culture?</p>\n<p>\"What if it's just simply a message that that diversity exists and we should embrace it?\" He paused. \"The fairytales don't carry grand lessons with them, but they do carry a legacy, Same thing that happened during Soviet occupation of Ukraine, with how their fairytales survived because the invaders thought that they had no message of their own. Maybe it's something similair, here?\"</p>\n<p>\"I\u2014\"</p>\n<p>Before Luca could intersect, a dull <em>ping</em> from Harry's pager interrupted him. The archivist pulled the device up. \"Lillian's got our copy, it seems, all free of memetics. That should give us some more insight.\" He looked at Luca. \"We better not keep her waiting.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[\ud83d\udf02]</p>\n<p>After so long down in the archives, they both found, their legs didn't quite work as well as they would have hoped. That Memetics &amp; Countermemetics was situated on the other side of the facility certainly didn't help, either. Still: their long and grueling march gave them time enough to mull everything over, forming a relatively coherent image of Huizinga and their plan going forward, in regards to said image.</p>\n<p>They only stopped brainstorming once they stood before the door to a large shared research room.</p>\n<p>It wasn't much compared to Lillian's own, personal office \u2014 which, as Luca had previously seen once and as Harry had seen many, many times was a work of art in its own right \u2014 but the place was still well-equipped and professional, even given the Foundation's already high base standards. Its walls were lined with apparatus neither of the archivists could even guess the purpose of, stuck right between tubes of carbon paper writ with similarly alien runes.</p>\n<p>The middle of the room, however, was where its <em>pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance</em> stood.</p>\n<p>It was a giant thing, some two meters tall and maybe three meters wide, all clean, grey panels and press modules. It looked like it cost more than a small Area in its own right. With its control buttons, circular lights, and small screens, it looked\u2014</p>\n<p>\"\u2026Straight out of <em>Star Trek</em>.\" Luca whispered to himself, his face a half-formed grin.</p>\n<p>Harry caught it, and smiled too, though far more widely than Luca. He was glad someone else had finally also seen his vision.</p>\n<p>\"See?\" Lillian started walking towards the two archivists. \"I told you you two'd get along,\" she said, pointing at Luca. \"And yeah, with how much funding I needed redirected to get that thing here you can bet your ass it could belong on a set.\" Before Luca could get even more flustered by realizing that both of them had heard his comment, she continued, \"Anyway. Here's your fuckin' book, nerds. Free of all the shit that'd make you talk nonsense.\"</p>\n<p>She pointed to a tome laying on the worktable next to the machine. It looked pretty much identical to the one that Luca had seen before, when he had been sent the initial find. The only exception was that this copy didn't have the cover the original had \u2014 instead, it was neatly wrapped in translucent, green-ish foil, the letters still visible even despite the covering.</p>\n<p>Luca came forward, towards the book. \"So, what's your impression? Of the whole thing, I mean. Are the runes <em>giftschreiber</em> or not?\"</p>\n<p>Heather came closer, leaning against the table. \"Not by a long shot.\" She was speaking again in English now; her and Lillian had waited two hours before calling Harry and Luca in so that the effect would die down. Two hours that they'd spent actually cleaning this place up, after they drowned it in a sea of memetic symbols by untackling the composition of the book.</p>\n<p>\"Hmm.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah,\" Lillihammer chined in. \"There's no way he's one of them. It's all too jumbled up in-between sappy metaphors to be them. They prefer using more annoying allegories.\" She crossed her arms, and for a second, the silver of her engagement ring sparkled beneath the lab's LED lights.</p>\n<p>Luca smiled again, quickly seeing very similar jewelry on Heather's own finger. These two have gone a long way since she'd first met Heather. Even though he still remained ambivalent towards Lillian (admiration was a strange mix when confronted with irritation), he was happy they'd found each other. He knew all too well how solitary it could get, here in the Foundation, for people like them. For people that weren't made to fit the mold of a standard researcher that asked no questions and had no doubts. Even with a dating pool as diverse and as global as the one offered by their shared conspiracy, finding someone of kindred spirit wasn't easy. He sure as hell wasn't any closer to figuring it all out, even all those years later. Truth be told, he didn't even want to consider the meeting he had last week to have been a date. It was a mess. He didn't need another STEM guy who thinks literature isn't worth his precious time.</p>\n<p>It was a heavy burdain, his search for a significant other, one he had struggled through most of his life; one he figured he'd spend some time more still unraveling.</p>\n<p>These two, however, were made for each other. He was glad they didn't have to go through the same nonsense he had to.</p>\n<p>They'd do great things together. Of that, he was sure.</p>\n<p>\"What about you?\" Heather asked. \"How's your front holding up? Not a <em>giftschreiber</em>?\"</p>\n<p>Harry nodded. \"Not a <em>giftschreiber</em>. Some flavor of memetic and vaguely pretentious but definitely not one of the nutcases.\"</p>\n<p>Lillian. \"Good. That's good.\" She put her hands together, and eyed the two archivists. \"Now. Now that you've got what you wanted\u2014\" She eyed the book. \"Shoo, with you two.\" She grinned, and looked at Heather, almost as if asking if this was enough to make her no longer talk about needing to help Luca. \"We've got important work to attend to. Important work that doesn't feature old nonsense.\"</p>\n<p>\"Just the new nonsense,\" Heather said, handing Luca the book. \"But yeah, as great as it was to catch up\u2026\" She shrugged. \"Sorry, Luca. You know how it goes.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. Of course. I know you've got work.\"</p>\n<p>Harry rolled his eyes. \"Sure they do.\" He was already half-way through the door when he turned around to Luca, and said, \"Oh, and please try not to drop the book. I think J&amp;M would kill us if we had to report another thing after last week's poker session with Willie.\"</p>\n<p>Luca didn't ask. He didn't even raise an eyebrow. Instead, he just grabbed the book more tightly and caught up with the other archivist.</p>\n<p>Some things, he'd found, were better left without answers.</p>\n<p>Particularly in a place like this.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[\ud83d\udf02]</p>\n<p>By the time Lillian and Heather made it to the shared Sublevel Three cafeteria to eat their last meal before calling it a day, they were fairly certain the sun had already risen, all the way up on the surface.</p>\n<p>Not that they'd notice it, of course, or even particularly care; just like with everything else, the two rarely \u2014 if ever \u2014 followed the expectations of others. Particularly when said expectations were as widely accepted and limiting as that of the day and night cycle.</p>\n<p>Still: when they took up their trays and loaded their food, they had to admit the place was no longer deserted, as it mostly would be during the night. Now, dozens of personnel were coming in. They were almost exclusively Janitorial &amp; Maintenance staff, as it was an unwritten custom for them to begin work before the other sections did, and although they weren't a crowd quite yet, they were not what the two memeticist had expected.</p>\n<p>Lillian sighed, and quickly sat down with Heather in the most remote table offered by the cafeteria, hoping its isolation would be enough to render them invisible to the others. She didn't hate the manual laborers of Site-43, specifically \u2014 nobody in their right mind did. She just hated people, in general, so she thought it'd be better for her and them if she remained isolated from the forming group, especially this late into the night.</p>\n<p>The moment their trays touched the table, Lillian sighed again, and started massaging her temples.</p>\n<p>Heather nodded. \"Yeah. Long day.\"</p>\n<p>\"Loooooong day.\" Lillian agreed. She blinked twice, and started playing with the fork, vaguely poking the foot on her plate. \"Waste of time, too.\"</p>\n<p>Heather gave her a look. \"Come on, Lils. You know I couldn't say no. Not to Luca.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. I know. That's why I'm complaining.\" She took a bite, only to realize she wasn't particularly hungry. She just had to wait for Heather to come to the same realization, then, before they could retire to their shared dormitory and retire for the night \u2014 and before someone dumped another nonsense project on their lap.</p>\n<p>Heather grinned. \"Is someone jealous?\"</p>\n<p>Lillian scoffed, amused. \"No. I just don't like not getting closure.\"</p>\n<p>Her partner raised an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\"We figured out the how but not the why, is my point,\" she said, propping herself up. \"That's not good enough.\"</p>\n<p>\"And here I was, thinking you didn't want to dedicate any more time to this.\"</p>\n<p>Lillian rolled her eyes. \"You're hopeless,\" she said, but smiled.</p>\n<p>They continued like that in silence for a couple more minutes, only occasionally getting interrupted by Heather actually eating \u2014 much to Lillian's dismay \u2014 and the sporadic chit-chat from J&amp;M personnel making its way from the center of the room.</p>\n<p>Eventually, though, Lillian admitted: \"Fine. You're right. I'm mad we did end it like that. I wish we could've done more.\" She crossed her arms. \"Not at the cost of our actual schedule, of course, but in general.\" She waved circles with her hand, and groaned. \"It's bullshit we didn't get it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Lils, but we did. Come on. You unraveled a complicated meme in the time it takes most people to stop speaking Dutch from looking at it.\" She smiled faintly. \"Besides: getting the context of it isn't our job. It's no use troubling yourself over something that's not your responsibility.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sure. But maybe actually knowing the reason they had it in their stash could help us with future nonsense.\" She sighed. \"Even knowing why he made it would help.\"</p>\n<p>Heather took another bite, and considered. When she next spoke, her meal was finished. \"If it helps, I have two hours to spare tomorrow. I can dedicate them to reverse-engineering that thing, if you'd like. Maybe getting it to work for other languages would\u2014\"</p>\n<p>Suddenly, her eyes went wide, as did Lillian's.</p>\n<p>At the very same time, the two of them got it.</p>\n<p>\"Oh shit.\"</p>\n<p>Lillian smiled, and both of them immediately stood up.</p>\n<p>\"Oh shit indeed.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[\ud83d\udf02]</p>\n<p>When they got back to Harry's office, they soon found out that even the wonders of coffee had an upper limit to their magic. They found it out the hard way, when they sat back in their chairs and immediately felt the length of the day weigh down on their shoulders the second they made themselves comfortable.</p>\n<p>Luca endured, somehow, by browsing through the pages of the meme-free book and paying it barely any attention. The letters were starting to look very skimmable, turning into pretty much nonsense, but he was still standing, trying to make sense of what little he could make out from the actual text.</p>\n<p>Harry, however, wasn't so lucky. He gave into the exhaustion pretty much instantly, half-laying on the desk, his glasses still on his head.</p>\n<p>They stayed like that for a while until eventually \u2014 and without much enthusiasm \u2014 Luca said, \"So, uh, do you speak any Dutch? Besides curses, I mean, and surface level stuff. That I can manage myself.\"</p>\n<p>Luca's voice was barely more than a whisper, but it still rippled through the silent archives like thunder.</p>\n<p>Harry jolted awake, almost hitting his head on the desk lamp above him. He looked like whatever it was he had been dreaming about, it had been far more engaging than the task at hand. \"Uh, no? Not really. I know some few words, maybe, but\u2026\" He shrugged. Just like everyone of his background, he'd picked up French sometime along the way of personal life and academia, but he'd never been much of a polyglot. He much preferred the other kind of incomprehensible texts \u2014 the ones they actually payed him to unravel.</p>\n<p>\"That's what Clio's for,\" Harry said, and smiled at his own joke. Luca had no way of knowing who Cliometria.aic was \u2014 or indeed that she had been created for the express purpose of handling material incomprehensible or too memetically confusing for standard humans to get \u2014 but that didn't stop Harry. Amusing nobody but himself was the expected baseline for his humor.</p>\n<p>Eventually, though, his smile died down, and he became serious. \"Why do you ask?\"</p>\n<p>Luca vaguely gestured towards the opened book. \"I'm trying to see if there's anything interesting to anyone but myself in this, or if it's just fairy tales like the file said. Whether there's something in-between the lines.\"</p>\n<p>Harry skewed his head. \"Didn't you\u2026 read it, when you actually spoke Dutch? In those two hours, I mean?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, but it's not the same, is it? I have memories of it, sure, but\u2026 I have memories of what the text talks about, but those memories wouldn't really be the same. Translation wouldn't be as precise, either. Not exactly. It certainly seemed to click more when I actually understood the words properly. But now\u2026\" he blew out air. \"Yeah.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmm.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmm?\"</p>\n<p>\"What if that's the point?\"</p>\n<p>Luca blinked. \"What do you mean?\"</p>\n<p>Harry scratched his head. \"We've got a guy who very clearly cares about the plurality of human societies. Someone who recognizes the value of distinct cultural identities without turning that rhetoric into fascist bullshit.\" He tapped the book. \"A guy that goes out of his way to not only create a book that can make you not just see the experience of the other, but actually <em>feel</em> it. Feel it as intended, not as a flattened localization.</p>\n<p>\"What if that's the whole point?\"</p>\n<p>Luca blinked again.

Personnel handling SCP-XXXX are to notify the SCP-XXXX project lead, --Senior Researcher Luca Armaros-- Dr. Lilllian Lillihammer.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-XXXX is a leather-bound tome attributed in authorship to Johan Huizinga, a Dutch historian and linguist, as well as [[[parker-informational-breach|suspected thaumaturge]]] and hermeneuticist.\u00a0\u00a0Its cover is bereft of any illustrations, save for the author's name and the title, which reads \"Sprookjes\" (//Fairy Tales// in Dutch).\n\n\n\nSCP-XXXX's content matches the expectation given by its title; the 159-page tome is filled with illustrated Dutch fairy tales,[[footnote]] Such as the stories of //Witte Wieven//, //Vrouwtje van Stavoren//, //Vliegende// Hollander, or //Bokkenrijders//. [[/footnote]] all of which had been hand-written using ink. Analysis revealed the writing matches with that of Huizinga.\n\n\n\nSCP-XXXX activates when a subject opens its first page. Upon coming into visual contact with it, the person interacting with the object will promptly cease to understand any languages other than Dutch (even if, before, they had no skills in Dutch at all). For the next two hours, the affected individual will be incapable of thinking, writing, and reading in any language but Dutch. After the two hour mark, the effect will cease, and the subject's linguistic skills will be returned to their basic state. The effects will remanifest upon further contact with SCP-XXXX.\n\n\n\nSCP-XXXX was recovered during a raid on a //giftschreiber//[[footnote]]\"Poison writers\" in German. A memetic doomsday cult. Aimed at immanentizing the eschaton through the proliferation of chaos and unrest via the deployment of memetic agents, the //giftschreiber// carry the ideology of liberation through total anarchy.

[[/footnote]] outpost carried out by Mobile Task Force Rho-43 (\"Home Invaders\"), led by Dr. Lillian Lillihammer on 27/08/2024. Although the book bears no obvious markings identifying it as a //giftschreiber// artifact, it was nevertheless stored on-site alongside several other tomes of memetic nature, suggesting a connection between the object, its author, and the Group of Interest.\n\n\n\nFurther investigation into its properties as well as into the nature of its author is ongoing.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n\"Hmm.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\n\n\"//Hrmm//,\" repeated Lillian Lillihammer, standing up and scratching her chin. \"Yeah, this isn't going to work.\"\n\n\n\n[[[scp-8166|Luca Armaros]]] blinked twice, looking away from the tome in front of him and up, towards Lillian's towering figure. \"What? Why not?\"\n\n\n\n\"Because I //already know Dutch//, so it's as good as useless on me,\" she said, pacing around the table. Before he could ask, she added: \"You pick it up after one too many days with Ilse.\"\n\n\n\nHe corrected his half-moon glasses. \"Hold on, Lillian--\"\n\n\n\n\"That's //doctor// Lillihammer.\"\n\n\n\n\"Apologies, //Doctor// Lillihammer. Heather told me you were the best of the best. That if anyone could make sense of it, you could. Am I to understand that she was wrong?\"\n\n\n\nShe rolled her eyes, but vaguely smirked at the mention of her fianc\u00e9e's name. It wasn't that she wasn't good enough to help Armaros; it was that this was an anomaly that simple to be worth her time. In a schedule as tight as hers -- and as packed with saving the world from memetic doomsday cults -- she didn't care to lose time with low-stakes drivel such as this. Not even as a break from her actually important work.\n\n\n\n...But on the other hand, Heather had asked her to help Luca out.\n\n\n\nShe had asked her very, very nicely.\n\n\n\nThere weren't many people Lillian could tolerate -- there were even less whose company she actively enjoyed. Heather Garrison, however, was as close as people could get to the latter category without quite literally being Lillian Lillihammer. She'd give her life to protect that woman, so she supposed that a week of her time wasn't too outrageous of an alternative. Besides: she knew Heather and Armaros went [[[the-legend-of-the-iron-goat|way back]]]. He might have been a dork of the more pathetic sort, but //he// was the one who saw something more in Heather than the glorified paper-pusher the Foundation's bureaucratic machine had appointed her as. He was the one who made her see the potential she had -- the potential which, inevitably, brought her to Lillihammer's side.\n\n\n\n\"Ugh. Fine,\" she said, rubbing her eyes. \"But don't expect miracles, archivist.\" She pointed her long finger directly in-between Luca's eyes. \"I don't have the time to perform them for you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thank you, I really--\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, yes, save your platitudes for when I'm done. In the meantime,\" she said, throwing Luca a folder with the relevant documentation. He caught it, but only barely. \"Make yourself useful.\"\n\n\n\nHe raised an eyebrow.\n\n\n\n\"Huizinga isn't going to figure himself out himself. I need to know if the man was a //giftschreiber// or just a nerd.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, all of my material is back at Site--\"\n\n\n\nShe waved her hand. \"That won't be necessary. I've already told a local friend of mine he'll be helping you. He knows his books, trust you me. Especially those whose words have been Poisoned.\" She turned towards the nearest file cabinet, already starting to browse through the gathered documents. \"I'll send you a meme-free scan when I get the chance.\"\n\n\n\n\"I... I'm not sure if I'd be the greatest research partner? I, uh, like to talk a lot during--\"\n\n\n\nShe turned back, eyed him up and down, then raised an eyebrow. \"Harry hasn't had a single good thing to do since he's gotten married. Besides,\" she said, smirking, and shifting her attention once more towards something else. \"With how much nonsense you both talk, I'm sure you two will get along just //swimmingly//.\"\n\n\n\n= [\ud83d\udf02]\n\n\n\nLuca had been to Site-43 a few times before, in the long years that had passed since he'd first crossed paths with Heather.\n\n\n\nStill: he never did get used to the layout.\n\n\n\nAll of his trips had been nothing but momentary transfers, more aimed at catching up with an old friend than actual scientific progress. In a field as seemingly insignificant to the Foundation's mission at large as his, the occasional tour was a privilege he could afford, but one he nevertheless remained ambivalent towards. Sure, actually talking with Heather was better than the occasional text they'd still send each other, but the facility was... well. Even for his standards, it was //weird//.\n\n\n\nIt was practically a tomb, with how deep it had been constructed; a tomb filled with esoteric waste and more esoteric legacies still. Its long, white corridors came together to form quite the labyrinth -- one that Luca had trouble navigating even with the three subway lines connecting it together. The people, too, were far from the Foundation baseline he'd come to expect. Given his own condition, he recognized the irony of that thought, of course, but there were only so many janitors with personal mirror monsters or time-stuck researchers he could meet before starting to question his own sanity.\n\n\n\nStill: when he had gotten the message some week ago that Sophia was briefly transferring him back to this place, he welcomed it as a good change of pace. Of course, it was nothing compared to the change of pace he had felt a few days prior when the apparently hermeneutic artifact he had been sent briefly turned him into a citizen of Utrecht in all but name, but it was at least something.\n\n\n\n//Maybe here they'll take my work as more than a curiosity//, he thought as he came to a sudden stop.\n\n\n\nIt took him nearly an hour of wandering through old abatement facilities and jam-packed common rooms, but he finally made it to his destination. \n\n\n\nThe lettering upon the heavy door in front of him simply read:\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n\n\n+++\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Harold R.

That was that, then.\n\n\n\nHe took a deep breath, cleared his throat, and -- having knocked, as nothing but a courtesy -- walked through.\n\n\n\nIf he had considered Site-43 a tomb before, what lay before him had to be at least a mausoleum.\n\n\n\nIt was a pretentious space, in the way that the offices of all intellectuals were. Unlike all of its other brethren, however, this one had a heart. Perhaps too much, in some parts, but the owner's character nevertheless permeated through the place like an ambient spiritual energy. From the neatly-organized Pink Floyd CD collection to a frighteningly long bookshelf containing all of Tolkien's (both senior and junior) written work, it was a lot. It was a lot, but it certainly spoke to Luca's heart. The image of the man who owned this office was completed by two things: a photo\u00a0\u00a0of an older, smiling woman standing in a park next to a similar but younger woman, framed neatly next to the laptop on top of the desk, and the man himself, his long-haired silhouette only barely sticking out of the stacks of books and paper all around him.\n\n\n\nAll things considered, Luca thought, the place fit him well. He cleared his throat again. This time, the man did react; he first slowly poked his silver head up, blinked twice, corrected his glasses, and then smiled politely.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes, hello,\" he said, quickly standing up. \"I see you managed to find your way down to my sanctuary.\"\n\n\n\nYes, Luca had to admit, the place did look maybe one step removed from a hermitage. \"Yeah. Glad, uh, glad I could make it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Indeed.\" The man extended his hand. \"Harry, as I'm sure you've noticed on your way in. Nice to meet you... Luca, I presume?\"\n\n\n\n\"Luca Armaros, yes,\" he said, shaking Harry's hand. \"The pleasure is all mine.\"\n\n\n\n\"Lil told me to expect you. Not that I expected you so soon, but...\" He waved his hand. \"Well. I wasn't being of much use anyway.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, I did consider whether I should come later, since maybe you could still be asleep, and--\"\n\n\n\nHarry smiled, and sat back down on his chair. \"Don't worry. You couldn't have woken me up. That's not a possibility I've even tried to manifest tonight. Do make yourself comfortable -- as comfortable as you can get in here, anyway,\" he said, pointing towards the nearest chair. \"I don't think we'll achieve much standing.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes, right,\" Luca mumbled out, and sat down. \"Of course\"\n\n\n\nHe looked at Harry. As if on command, both corrected their glasses.\n\n\n\n\"So,\" Harry said, clapping his hands. \"How exactly can I help you?\"\n\n\n\n= [\ud83d\udf02]\n\n\n\n\"How do you think it's layered?\"\n\n\n\n\"//Wat?//\"\n\n\n\n//Oh. Right.// Lillihammer adjusted herself mentally, cleared her throat, and continued in the appropriate language: \"//Hoe denk je dat het opgebouwd is?//\" she asked, carefully looking at the pages laying in front of her.\n\n\n\nFrom a certain angle, the letters almost seemed to glow. This was certainly by design; the room around them -- her own personal office, a hermetic memetic exclusion zone created from scratch and filled with preventive measures the likes of which the world had never before seen -- was constructed in such a way so as to highlight any foreign glyphs present inside. Still: the almost ephemeral glow was not what Lillian had expected. She'd thought this would be some simple //giftschreiber// trick, a proof-of-concept of a real end product aimed at causing actual chaos. But this? This fit none of the patterns she could ever remember seeing, and she trusted her memory more than herself.\n\n\n\n\"//It's definitely not the baseline eye-mind connection, that's for sure,//\" Heather said, putting another page of the manuscript against the giant printer. \"//It's strange.//\"\n\n\n\n\"Hmm.\"\n\n\n\nLillian leaned closer towards the tome, and narrowed her eyes.\n\n\n\n\"//This is nonsense. Utter nonsense.//\"\n\n\n\nHeather raised an eyebrow, but otherwise remained silently by her post, scanning the tome one //beep// after another.\n\n\n\nAs she always did when not uninterrupted -- and, more often than not, //especially// when interrupted -- Lillian continued. \"//It doesn't anchor itself to anything specific. It shouldn't work.//\" She threw her hand in the air. \"//It's just... an image, bound to no specific reaction. The fact that it actually instills any reaction is bullshit. It __shouldn't__//.\"\n\n\n\nHeather considered. \"//What if it's not meant to?//\"\n\n\n\nLillian actually blinked. \"//What?//\"\n\n\n\n\"//You're looking at it as if it was one of your kill agents, Lils.//\"\n\n\n\n\"//It's very clearly a similar mechanism. One look at it and you're fucked.//\" She paused. \"//It's just that this one doesn't kill you, just makes you Dutch. Which, to be fair, close enough, but--//\"\n\n\n\n\"//Lils.//\" Heather said, coming closer towards Lillian. She put a hand on her shoulder. //\"You're thinking about it as if it was a weapon. Why?//\"\n\n\n\nShe shrugged. \"//Because what the hell would you use this for, if not as a weapon? Some bullshit chaos tool the German nutcases wanted to use to spread Dutch into the rest of the adjacent languages, like what [[[scp-5382|Thilo's already once done]]].//\" She sighed. \"//My point is this: why make something like this if not for war?//\"\n\n\n\nHeather smiled. \"//That __is__ the right question, isn't it?//\"\n\n\n\n= [\ud83d\udf02]\n\n\n\n\"So, Huizinga, huh?\" Harry said, narrowing his eyes, Even from behind his thick frames, Luca could see him scan one line of database tables after another. \"Huizinga... Huizinga...\"\n\n\n\nHarry frowned -- more so than his usual, baseline expression -- and scratched his head. \"We've got a Huith, Huir, and Huitz in this thing, but no Huizinga.\" He popped his lips. \"Huh.\"\n\n\n\nFor a few moments, he remained still.\n\n\n\n\"So what, that's it?\" Luca said, the slightest tint of disheartment present in his tone. \"The line just ends here?\"\n\n\n\n\"Far worse.\" Harry looked him in the eyes. \"It leads to the physical archives.\"\n\n\n\nWith a heavy grunt, the historian stood up, and moved a few boxes, revealing the second part of his study: the place where all hopes and dreams died, or the bookshelves upon bookshelves of non-digitized documents belonging to the History Department. Originally, the job of actually getting them into the database proper had been assigned to junior researchers here at Forty-Three, but, well; after the last occupant of that particular slave labor had been blown to cross-dimensional and cross-deific bits by the Site's [[[scp-5243|annual cascade of cross-temporal bullshit]]], Harry hadn't had the heart to sentence anyone else to that fate.\n\n\n\nThat had been more than a decade ago; the documents, naturally, never did stop coming.\n\n\n\nWith the kind of gesture reserved for death row inmates, Harry signalled Luca to come closer. He obeyed, and after a moment found himself among an archive so large and expansive it pulled the breath out of his lungs. When he did take the next breath, however, he was smiling, much to Harry's dismay.\n\n\n\nHad he no job to do other than this assignment, Luca would have loved to do nothing but sort all of these papers and books. It was clear that nobody else was going to do it -- //obviously// -- but Luca could. It spoke to some particularly solitary part of his personality, seeing all of those countless documents just //waiting// to be cataloged and organized. He was, of course, still a man, but somewhere in his soul he was primarily an archivist, one who would love to see all of this made into a coherent whole.\n\n\n\nJudging by Harry's reaction, even their shared job and position could not help with crossing that particular bridge between their experiences.\n\n\n\n\"Well,\" he said, smiling slightly, \"I'm glad you don't see this place as the execution wall I've come to dread it as. Because we're going to spend a //long time here//,\" he added, crossing his arms and glancing at the heavy tonnes of paper under the section marked with a large, bolded 'H'.\n\n\n\n\"Better get started, then.\"\n\n\n\nHarry shrugged. \"Tomorrow's already caught me down here, so I do suppose I've got nothing to lose.\"\n\n\n\nSlowly, and with the kind of precision and worry mostly reserved for handling wild animals, Harry took the nearest ladder and stacked it up against the shelf in front of them. Before he could show Luca that he was free to climb first, Armaros was already halfway up.\n\n\n\n\"Hmm. //Hmm//.\" He grunted, slowly starting to rummage through piles upon piles of cross-referencial reports handling topics of no real interest to anyone but maybe Maria Jones herself. After a while that felt longer to Harry than it did to him, he eventually said, \"I think I've got something.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\n\nLuca narrowed his eyes through his glasses. \"It's... not quite a dossier, but it's //something//. Some... Some list of paranormal-adjacent linguists, I think, and...\"\n\n\n\nHe reached out towards one level higher, shifting his weight to the front of his body. \"...and he's here! He's--\"\n\n\n\nSuddenly, and without any fault of his own, he felt the ladder slip from under his feet. Seeing how the only things he could grab onto were the shelf itself and the books inside it, he didn't have enough actual leverage to avoid the fall. Before he could think of anything else to do -- or indeed react to this at all, in the fraction of a second his mind had been given to process the fact that was about to transpire -- he surrendered to gravity, taking with him some ten kilos of yellow paper nobody except him had seen since they had been printed.\n\n\n\nSomewhere in-between all of that, he managed to half-swear, \"Pancakes!\" before he landed on the solid floor with a heavy thud, burying himself under a self-made blanket of pages.\n\n\n\nWithout hesitation, Harry reached out, taking off the first layer.\n\n\n\nBeneath it, Luca lay in a fetal position, his body covered by one more veneer: one made from his own four blue wings, sprouting from his back, now no longer hidden under his Foundation-issued uniform. No scratches or bruised blemished his body -- the power that had sprouted his new appendages so many years ago made sure that no harm came to him from sources as mundane as this.\n\n\n\nWhen Luca opened his eyes again, the spark from previously had disappeared -- in their place there now was worry.\n\n\n\nIn his long years working here, Harry had seen that brand of fear many, many times. He knew what it meant more so than he wished he did.\n\n\n\n\"I... I'm sorry,\" Luca said, slowly standing up, his head down. \"I didn't...\" he trailed off, avoiding eye contact. His wings were low, now, clutched close to his back.\n\n\n\n\"Luca,\" Harry said, taking a deep breath. He had gone through this dance many times before, considering his place of employment. He could never relate, of course -- not fully -- but he did get how to get it. \"Come on. Nothing to apologize for.\"\n\n\n\nThe other archivist remained unconvinced. He'd heard this part many times before, too. He's long since forgiven himself for allowing himself to get trickd into becoming the Guardian, but it still wasn't the part of himself he wanted others to see first. He didn't want them to think of him as a monster, as some fool he was presented as during Site-19 lectures. He preferred to lay low, whenever he got the chance. It wasn't shame; more-so as a silent worry. Not of the possibility of bodily harm (his mantle of Guardian took care of that, mostly), but of what others could do to people like him, if they couldn't see past his first impression.\n\n\n\nHe almost-whispered, \"I don't want to--\"\n\n\n\n\"Listen.\" Harry looked him square in the eyes. \"My best friend is the student of an immortal Austrian wizard. My //second// best friend is bad luck incarnate. I once dated an //actual witch//. I don't care about any of that, Luca. I don't care what others might think of you. None of that defines you. What I see in front of me is a man dedicated to his job and passion. One whose help I need to do this.\n\n\n\n\"My point is this: I don't care, and neither should you.\"\n\n\n\nLuca stayed silent.\n\n\n\n\"...Because we've still got an actual metric ton of documents to go through.\" He smiled, now, the gesture warm and honest. \"You don't think I'd let you leave before we finished this, did you? I know our words come alive here at Forty-Three far more often than in other parts of the Foundation, but even here, the cases don't solve themselves, Mr. Archivist. So get back here and let's get this thing sorted, eh?\n\n\n\nLuca didn't say anything, for a very long second.\n\n\n\nThen, he smiled back.\n\n\n\n= [\ud83d\udf02]\n\n\n\nShe scratched her chin, for what was possibly the millionth time this evening. She was beginning to ponder if she had a nervous tick. \"//I do wonder,//\" Lillian said, coming closer to Heather and leaning over the book.\n\n\n\nHeather chuckled. \"//You always do, Lils. What about, this time?//\"\n\n\n\n\"//How this exactly works, without a trigger.//\"\n\n\n\nThe other memeticist rolled her eyes. \"//Yes, we've already gone over that. We--//\"\n\n\n\n\"//No, I mean actually. Like,//\" she said, stabbing one of the pages with her finger. //\"None of the signs indicate any coercion. It's just... a soup of memetic symbols, none of them particularly bound together into a single formula.//\" \n\n\n\n\"//Wait//,\" Heather said, smiling, \"d//id you just admit that you don't know the answer, babe?//\"\n\n\n\nLillian groaned. She did not like not knowing things. \"//It doesn't add up. It shouldn't just do nothing because it's got no target -- it should do nothing because it __does not__ do anything.//\"\n\n\n\nFor a moment, Heather considered, carrying over the last copied pages onto the binding machine. \"//Well, I think it's all just about perspective, really.//\"\n\n\n\nLillian raised an eyebrow. \"//What?//\"\n\n\n\n\"//If it's not an immediate effect, maybe it's something slower. Something more gradual, perhaps, not so immediate -- something far more subtle. Something not intrusive.//\" She paused. //\"Who do you think Huizinga was, really? Beneath all of that work we're analyzing.//\"\n\n\n\nThe eyebrow now turned into an arch. \"//That's... what Harry and Armaros are trying to figure out.//\"\n\n\n\nHeather shook her head. \"//I don't mean what he was. What he worked as, or what group he possibly aligned himself with,//\" she said. \"//I'm asking who he was __really__, beneath all of those titles. I'm sure you can remember something.//\"\n\n\n\nAfter a second of searching, Lillian found that Heather indeed was right. There //was// something about Huizinga in that perfect memory of hers that she could salvage. She decided to indulge her. \"//An historian, primarily. Also a linguist. Travelled a lot.//\" She paused. //\"So someone who cared about the world, in its entirety. Tried to care, anyway. Tried to see the bigger picture.//\"\n\n\n\n\"//Yeah. So __why__ would he make this?//\"\n\n\n\nLillian groaned. \"//That's the whole--//\"\n\n\n\n\"//No, Lils. Stop being stupid, Why do you __think__ he would make it? I don't care about truth, I want your opinion. Why do you think someone like him would make a memetic tool -- one that doesn't have an aggressive effect and is tied to a single, unassuming object? One that can bring no harm to anyone? One bound to a book, out of all things?//\"\n\n\n\nNormally, there were two things Lillian despised, more than anything else -- being interrupted, and being lectured. Heather, however, was anything but normal; she was one of the few people that could match her speed (and her interest). Though Lillian possessed a proficiency in pretty much all subjects she wished to possess a proficiency in, one thing she never could figure out fully was how normal people thought. She could predict them, better so than almost anyone else alive, and she could manipulate them to her own ends -- but getting to see down-to-earth things through their eyes was something else entirely. It didn't escape her -- it just actively bored her.\n\n\n\nHeather, however, always could see the grander picture, especially when it came to memetics.\n\n\n\nIt was her job, after all.\n\n\n\nLillian considered. She looked down at the book. The //book//. Oh. \"//To make them do something, but of their own volition. Not to force them, but to point to some direction -- show them the path towards noticing something. Just like a book.//\"\n\n\n\n\"//Just like a book, yeah. And where does that lead us? If not to the mind, like you already established, then where?//\" She came closer, and put her hand on Lillian's. Very slowly, she navigated both towards one of the symbols written on the page. \"//And don't say that it was to make people learn Dutch. Who would actually want that?//\"\n\n\n\nLillian blinked twice.\n\n\n\nThen, she got it.\n\n\n\n\"//To the heart. Whatever it is, the message leads right to your heart.\"//\n\n\n\n= [\ud83d\udf02]\n\n\n\nLuca had thought it'd be an easy job, all things considered. \n\n\n\nHis optimism did not waver when faced with the archives; it didn't even waver when he realized they were going to have to compile a timeline.\n\n\n\nBut when, by the five hour mark, they'd barely scratched the surface of the iceberg, he //was// beginning to question whether this was a one day job.\n\n\n\nHarry sighed, rubbed his eyes, and turned over another page of some manuscript older than them both (which, considering both were technically semi-immortal, was quite the achievement). He noted something down, propped his head up, and went back to reading.\n\n\n\nAfter a while, he turned to face Luca. \"You got anything?\"\n\n\n\nLuca popped his lips. \"Nothing new. Nothing new that's //exciting//, I guess I should say.\" He blinked twice, already feeling the exhaustion from all the work starting to creep in. \"If I have to read about one more historical summit...\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah.\" Harry put the book aside. \"Yeah. Too much even for me.\" Just like any real historian, Harry did have an admiration for the great work that Huizinga's contributions had carried over to his field of study. But, after as long as this -- and as late as this -- his admiration even for a man like him started to turn into ennui. He looked at the tome for some few seconds, then diverted his sight back towards Luca. \"This clearly isn't working,\" he said, picking up his notes.\n\n\n\nLuca raised an eyebrow.\n\n\n\n\"We've got a timeline of his life and major cross-references, but none of it is of any actual use.\"\n\n\n\nLuca put up his finger, trying in a positive tone, \"Maybe sometimes absence of evidence //is// evidence of ab--\"\n\n\n\n\"Right, yes, yes, but we can't be //sure// because there's nothing concrete in this goddamn thing. No lines to draw immediate conclusion through.\" He sighed. \"I was built for reading, not for... this nonsense vague intention analysis. Half a degree in literature does not an English teacher make,\" he said, a bitter chuckle entering his lips.\n\n\n\nYes, half a degree in literature studies barely made someone an expert; but a full one did. Luca //was// built for this exact thing. He smiled very slowly. \"I think we ought to step back and look at what we've got.\"\n\n\n\nHarry gave him a look. \"And what //do// we've got?\"\n\n\n\n\"Time to find out, no?\" he said, standing up.\n\n\n\nHarry grunted, but soon followed Luca's stead.\n\n\n\nBefore long, they were looking at a lot of very badly handwritten post-it notes, all assembled together into a grotesque imitation of a mosaic.\n\n\n\n\"Like I said: there's not much here,\" Harry said, unconvinced. \"Unless you really want to read about tea parties.\"\n\n\n\nLuca nodded. \"Right. But it does paint us a picture of him, doesn't it?\"\n\n\n\n\"I suppose so.\" Harry considered. \"What are you looking for, exactly?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm trying to see what kind of man arises as an image from this all. What general outlines we can trace to who he was.\"\n\n\n\nThat got Harry's attention. \"Well. He wasn't a shit, for starters. Rare in those times.\" He pointed to one of the notes. \"He opposed the Nazis pretty heavily back in the thirtees.\"\n\n\n\n\"Do you think a //giftschreiber// would do that? Try to avoid the chaos and suffering that followed?\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, no, but I don't want to cross him out on the basis of one claim. Just one source isn't going to cut it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Right.\" Luca paused, pondering.\n\n\n\nHarry said, \"It's also clear he wasn't narrow-minded. Tried to not be, in any case.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, the travel log's rather impressive. As are his linguistics,\" he added, snapping his fingers at some table of data. \"Sanskrit and German aren't too bad for a man of his times.\"\n\n\n\nHarry nodded. He was fully in lecture mode, now. He was starting to enjoy this. \"With the exception of //The Autumn//, he's also written a few things on culture. //Also// shockingly progressive and open-minded. Cared about art and the human spirit.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hmm.\"\n\n\n\nHarry sighed, one more time. \"All right, I yield. This is no //giftschreiber// profile. Not unless he was absurdly covert. Which,\" he said, \"for the sake of our own sanity, I won't for now consider.\n\n\n\n\"However,\" he continued, unwilling to surrender his point, \"just because he wasn't this particular brand of memetic cultist doesn't mean he wasn't one of some other.\"\n\n\n\n\"Of course. But he definitely wasn't one of the apocalypse-harbinging ones, on that we can agree.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes.\" Harry scratched his nose. \"For what it's worth, the man genuinely did seem to care about the artistic and cultural legacy of humanity, enough to try to protect it.\" He waved his hand. \"The non-fascist read on legacy, I mean.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. It's clear he found great value in what he studied.\"\n\n\n\n\"Mhm.\"\n\n\n\n\"So what //was// his work doing in a //giftschreiber// stash? If it wasn't written by one of theirs, what use is it to them?\"\n\n\n\nHarry considered. \"Maybe as a contrast. An instruction, what not to do.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hardly his best work for that particular lesson.\"\n\n\n\n\"//If// the lesson they got from it is the one we are also assuming, that is.\"\n\n\n\nLuca skewed his head. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n\n\"What if it isn't just about the obvious plurality of human culture, from an academic standpoint?\"\n\n\n\n\"Are you proposing a more... down to earth read?\"\n\n\n\nHarry nodded. \"It //is// a fairytale book, after all. Hardly the most serious of sources for academia,\" he said. \"But yes. What if it isn't some serious message about the inner workings of a\u00a0\u00a0human culture?\n\n\n\n\"What if it's just simply a message that that diversity exists and we should embrace it?\" He paused. \"The fairytales don't carry grand lessons with them, but they do carry a legacy, Same thing that happened during Soviet occupation of Ukraine, with how their fairytales survived because the invaders thought that they had no message of their own. Maybe it's something similair, here?\"\n\n\n\n\"I--\"\n\n\n\nBefore Luca could intersect, a dull //ping// from Harry's pager interrupted him. The archivist pulled the device up. \"Lillian's got our copy, it seems, all free of memetics. That should give us some more insight.\" He looked at Luca. \"We better not keep her waiting.\"\n\n\n\n= [\ud83d\udf02]\n\n\n\nAfter so long down in the archives, they both found, their legs didn't quite work as well as they would have hoped. That Memetics & Countermemetics was situated on the other side of the facility certainly didn't help, either. Still: their long and grueling march gave them time enough to mull everything over, forming a relatively coherent image of Huizinga and their plan going forward, in regards to said image.\n\n\n\nThey only stopped brainstorming once they stood before the door to a large shared research room.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't much compared to Lillian's own, personal office -- which, as Luca had previously seen once and as Harry had seen many, many times was a work of art in its own right -- but the place was still well-equipped and professional, even given the Foundation's already high base standards. Its walls were lined with apparatus neither of the archivists could even guess the purpose of, stuck right between tubes of carbon paper writ with similarly alien runes.\n\n\n\nThe middle of the room, however, was where its //pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance// stood.\n\n\n\nIt was a giant thing, some two meters tall and maybe three meters wide, all clean, grey panels and press modules. It looked like it cost more than a small Area in its own right. With its control buttons, circular lights, and small screens, it looked--\n\n\n\n\"...Straight out of //Star Trek//.\" Luca whispered to himself, his face a half-formed grin.\n\n\n\nHarry caught it, and smiled too, though far more widely than Luca. He was glad someone else had finally also seen his vision.\n\n\n\n\"See?\" Lillian started walking towards the two archivists. \"I told you you two'd get along,\" she said, pointing at Luca. \"And yeah, with how much funding I needed redirected to get that thing here you can bet your ass it could belong on a set.\" Before Luca could get even more flustered by realizing that both of them had heard his comment, she continued, \"Anyway. Here's your fuckin' book, nerds. Free of all the shit that'd make you talk nonsense.\"\n\n\n\nShe pointed to a tome laying on the worktable next to the machine. It looked pretty much identical to the one that Luca had seen before, when he had been sent the initial find. The only exception was that this copy didn't have the cover the original had -- instead, it was neatly wrapped in translucent, green-ish foil, the letters still visible even despite the covering.\n\n\n\nLuca came forward, towards the book. \"So, what's your impression? Of the whole thing, I mean. Are the runes //giftschreiber// or not?\"\n\n\n\nHeather came closer, leaning against the table. \"Not by a long shot.\" She was speaking again in English now; her and Lillian had waited two hours before calling Harry and Luca in so that the effect would die down. Two hours that they'd spent actually cleaning this place up, after they drowned it in a sea of memetic symbols by untackling the composition of the book.\n\n\n\n\"Hmm.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lillihammer chined in. \"There's no way he's one of them. It's all too jumbled up in-between sappy metaphors to be them. They prefer using more annoying allegories.\" She crossed her arms, and for a second, the silver of her engagement ring sparkled beneath the lab's LED lights.\n\n\n\nLuca smiled again, quickly seeing very similar jewelry on Heather's own finger. These two have gone a long way since she'd first met Heather. Even though he still remained ambivalent towards Lillian (admiration was a strange mix when confronted with irritation), he was happy they'd found each other. He knew all too well how solitary it could get, here in the Foundation, for people like them. For people that weren't made to fit the mold of a standard researcher that asked no questions and had no doubts. Even with a dating pool as diverse and as global as the one offered by their shared conspiracy, finding someone of kindred spirit wasn't easy. He sure as hell wasn't any closer to figuring it all out, even all those years later. Truth be told, he didn't even want to consider the meeting he had last week to have been a date. It was a mess.\u00a0\u00a0He didn't need another STEM guy who thinks literature isn't worth his precious time.\n\n\n\nIt was a heavy burdain, his search for a significant other, one he had struggled through most of his life; one he figured he'd spend some time more still unraveling. \n\n\n\nThese two, however, were made for each other. He was glad they didn't have to go through the same nonsense he had to.\n\n\n\nThey'd do great things together. Of that, he was sure.\n\n\n\n\"What about you?\" Heather asked. \"How's your front holding up? Not a //giftschreiber//?\"\n\n\n\nHarry nodded. \"Not a //giftschreiber//. Some flavor of memetic and vaguely pretentious but definitely not one of the nutcases.\"\n\n\n\nLillian. \"Good. That's good.\" She put her hands together, and eyed the two archivists. \"Now. Now that you've got what you wanted\u2014\" She eyed the book. \"Shoo, with you two.\" She grinned, and looked at Heather, almost as if asking if this was enough to make her no longer talk about needing to help Luca. \"We've got important work to attend to. Important work that doesn't feature old nonsense.\"\n\n\n\n\"Just the new nonsense,\" Heather said, handing Luca the book. \"But yeah, as great as it was to catch up...\" She shrugged. \"Sorry, Luca. You know how it goes.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. Of course. I know you've got work.\"\n\n\n\nHarry rolled his eyes. \"Sure they do.\" He was already half-way through the door when he turned around to Luca, and said, \"Oh, and please try not to drop the book. I think J&M would kill us if we had to report another thing after last week's poker session with Willie.\"\n\n\n\nLuca didn't ask. He didn't even raise an eyebrow. Instead, he just grabbed the book more tightly and caught up with the other archivist.\n\n\n\nSome things, he'd found, were better left without answers.\n\n\n\nParticularly in a place like this.\n\n\n\n= [\ud83d\udf02]\n\n\n\nBy the time Lillian and Heather made it to the shared Sublevel Three cafeteria to eat their last meal before calling it a day, they were fairly certain the sun had already risen, all the way up on the surface.\n\n\n\nNot that they'd notice it, of course, or even particularly care; just like with everything else, the two rarely -- if ever -- followed the expectations of others. Particularly when said expectations were as widely accepted and limiting as that of the day and night cycle.\n\n\n\nStill: when they took up their trays and loaded their food, they had to admit the place was no longer deserted, as it mostly would be during the night. Now, dozens of personnel were coming in. They were almost exclusively Janitorial & Maintenance staff, as it was an unwritten custom for them to begin work before the other sections did, and although they weren't a crowd quite yet, they were not what the two memeticist had expected.\n\n\n\nLillian sighed, and quickly sat down with Heather in the most remote table offered by the cafeteria, hoping its isolation would be enough to render them invisible to the others. She didn't hate the manual laborers of Site-43, specifically -- nobody in their right mind did. She just hated people, in general, so she thought it'd be better for her and them if she remained isolated from the forming group, especially this late into the night.\n\n\n\nThe moment their trays touched the table, Lillian sighed again, and started massaging her temples.\n\n\n\nHeather nodded. \"Yeah. Long day.\"\n\n\n\n\"Loooooong day.\" Lillian agreed. She blinked twice, and started playing with the fork, vaguely poking the foot on her plate. \"Waste of time, too.\"\n\n\n\nHeather gave her a look. \"Come on, Lils. You know I couldn't say no. Not to Luca.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. I know. That's why I'm complaining.\" She took a bite, only to realize she wasn't particularly hungry. She just had to wait for Heather to come to the same realization, then, before they could retire to their shared dormitory and retire for the night -- and before someone dumped another nonsense project on their lap.\n\n\n\nHeather grinned. \"Is someone jealous?\"\n\n\n\nLillian scoffed, amused. \"No. I just don't like not getting closure.\"\n\n\n\nHer partner raised an eyebrow.\n\n\n\n\"We figured out the how but not the why, is my point,\" she said, propping herself up. \"That's not good enough.\"\n\n\n\n\"And here I was, thinking you didn't want to dedicate any more time to this.\"\n\n\n\nLillian rolled her eyes. \"You're hopeless,\" she said, but smiled.\n\n\n\nThey continued like that in silence for a couple more minutes, only occasionally getting interrupted by Heather actually eating -- much to Lillian's dismay -- and the sporadic chit-chat from J&M personnel making its way from the center of the room.\n\n\n\nEventually, though, Lillian admitted: \"Fine. You're right. I'm mad we did end it like that. I wish we could've done more.\" She crossed her arms. \"Not at the cost of our actual schedule, of course, but in general.\" She waved circles with her hand, and groaned. \"It's bullshit we didn't get it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, Lils, but we did. Come on. You unraveled a complicated meme in the time it takes most people to stop speaking Dutch from looking at it.\" She smiled faintly. \"Besides: getting the context of it isn't our job. It's no use troubling yourself over something that's not your responsibility.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sure. But maybe actually knowing the reason they had it in their stash could help us with future nonsense.\" She sighed. \"Even knowing why he made it would help.\"\n\n\n\nHeather took another bite, and considered. When she next spoke, her meal was finished. \"If it helps, I have two hours to spare tomorrow. I can dedicate them to reverse-engineering that thing, if you'd like. Maybe getting it to work for other languages would--\"\n\n\n\nSuddenly, her eyes went wide, as did Lillian's.\n\n\n\nAt the very same time, the two of them got it.\n\n\n\n\"Oh shit.\"\n\n\n\nLillian smiled, and both of them immediately stood up.\n\n\n\n\"Oh shit indeed.\"\n\n\n\n= [\ud83d\udf02]\n\n\n\nWhen they got back to Harry's office, they soon found out that even the wonders of coffee had an upper limit to their magic. They found it out the hard way, when they sat back in their chairs and immediately felt the length of the day weigh down on their shoulders the second they made themselves comfortable.\n\n\n\nLuca endured, somehow, by browsing through the pages of the meme-free book and paying it barely any attention. The letters were starting to look very skimmable, turning into pretty much nonsense, but he was still standing, trying to make sense of what little he could make out from the actual text.\n\n\n\nHarry, however, wasn't so lucky. He gave into the exhaustion pretty much instantly, half-laying on the desk, his glasses still on his head.\n\n\n\nThey stayed like that for a while until eventually -- and without much enthusiasm -- Luca said, \"So, uh, do you speak any Dutch? Besides curses, I mean, and surface level stuff. That I can manage myself.\"\n\n\n\nLuca's voice was barely more than a whisper, but it still rippled through the silent archives like thunder.\n\n\n\nHarry jolted awake, almost hitting his head on the desk lamp above him. He looked like whatever it was he had been dreaming about, it had been far more engaging than the task at hand. \"Uh, no? Not really. I know some few words, maybe, but...\" He shrugged. Just like everyone of his background, he'd picked up French sometime along the way of personal life and academia, but he'd never been much of a polyglot. He much preferred the other kind of incomprehensible texts -- the ones they actually payed him to unravel. \n\n\n\n\"That's what Clio's for,\" Harry said, and smiled at his own joke. Luca had no way of knowing who Cliometria.aic was -- or indeed that she had been created for the express purpose of handling material incomprehensible or too memetically confusing for standard humans to get -- but that didn't stop Harry. Amusing nobody but himself was the expected baseline for his humor.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nEventually, though, his smile died down, and he became serious. \"Why do you ask?\"\n\n\n\nLuca vaguely gestured towards the opened book. \"I'm trying to see if there's anything interesting to anyone but myself in this, or if it's just fairy tales like the file said. Whether there's something in-between the lines.\"\n\n\n\nHarry skewed his head. \"Didn't you... read it, when you actually spoke Dutch? In those two hours, I mean?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, but it's not the same, is it? I have memories of it, sure, but... I have memories of what the text talks about, but those memories wouldn't really be the same. Translation wouldn't be as precise, either. Not exactly. It certainly seemed to click more when I actually understood the words properly. But now...\" he blew out air. \"Yeah.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hmm.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\n\n\"What if that's the point?\"\n\n\n\nLuca blinked. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n\nHarry scratched his head. \"We've got a guy who very clearly cares about the plurality of human societies. Someone who recognizes the value of distinct cultural identities without turning that rhetoric into fascist bullshit.\" He tapped the book. \"A guy that goes out of his way to not only create a book that can make you not just see the experience of the other, but actually //feel// it. Feel it as intended, not as a flattened localization.\n\n\n\n\"What if that's the whole point?\"\n\n\n\nLuca blinked again. Both of them were too tired for the revelation to particularly strike them as much as it normally would. \"I... I suppose so? But doesn't that just feel too convenient to you? Too heartfelt?\"\n\n\n\n\"Maybe.\" Harry smiled. \"But in history, I've found, the most heartfelt answers are very often the best ones.\"\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Item \u2116:** SCP-XXXX {{[PENDING CLASSIFICATION]}}\n\n\n\n**Object Class:** Safe\n\n\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXXX is freely available for use to all Foundation personnel, and is to remain so for the foreseeable future. To ensure maximum efficiency, its usage should first be cataloged and scheduled with the SCP-XXXX project lead, Senior Researcher Luca Armaros.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-XXXX is a leather-bound tome hand-written by Johan Huizinga, a Dutch historian, linguist, and thaumaturgist. The 159-page tome is entirely filled with richly illustrated Dutch fairy tales and stories from Dutch folklore.[[footnote]] Such as the stories of //Witte Wieven//, //Vrouwtje van Stavoren//, //Vliegende// Hollander, or //Bokkenrijders//. [[/footnote]]\n\n\n\nSCP-XXXX was formerly the host of a circle class hermeneutic effect which changed the linguistic capabilities of subjects interacting with it by restricting it solely to Dutch for approximately two hours, even if the affected individual previously lacked any such skills. Following in-depth research, reverse engineering, and reprogramming work performed on the object by Drs. Lillihammer, Garrison, Blank, and Sr. Res. Armaros, it is now capable of instilling such an effect in a controlled manner. The duration of the effect -- as well as the instilled language -- are no longer limited to two hours and Dutch respectively; instead, the user is now capable of choosing from a wide array of 200 languages cataloged by the Foundation and embedded into the memetic effect, selecting the effect's intended duration.\n\n\n\nAs of writing, SCP-XXXX is utilized in all Site-43 and Site-19 contacts with ESL (English as a Second Language) subjects so as to ensure no vital information and/or perspectives are lost during the translation process which would otherwise inevitably occur during interviews, interrogations, and similar occasions.\n\n\n\n**Addendum XXXX-1:** On 16/11/2024, two months following the completion of the changes done to SCP-XXXX by Foundation personnel, the object started to undergo spontaneous changes, inexplicably growing in size by almost 300 pages.

Within two hours a manhunt unveiled a secret cult, merely moments after a ritualistic killing deep in the Yukon woodlands.

She spent most of her time knitting, reading, and watching television, occasionally visiting friends in the neighborhood. On this particular Christmas Eve in 1999, however, she's busy cleaning her home as the holiday spirit begins to set in, dutifully setting plates and hanging up decorations.</p>\n<p>At precisely 7:56 PM MST \u2014 known only because Mrs. Chance checked her watch moments earlier \u2014 a woman's scream echoes across the house. Dropping everything, Mrs. Chance runs to her front door, and is met with a terrifying sight: a cloaked figure dragging a screaming, kicking woman across her front lawn towards an unmarked black van. After a few moments of shock, she dashes for the landline and dials emergency services.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Chance speaks frantically into the phone. Although her report is sporadic and takes random turns, the dispatcher seems to pick up exactly what she's saying. Within mere minutes, a cop car is already set and ready to go.

The darkness and freezing snow means their progress is slow and difficult. However, the two persevere, even while the wind begins to pick up around them.</p>\n<p>As the tracks deepen and become more defined, Officer Dalton notices a faint glow directly ahead of them, which she immediately mentions to dispatch. When they approach, the officers soon fall completely silent, and stop walking entirely. Christopher later commented:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>It was nightmarish \u2014 something you'd see out of a cheap horror film, but gritty and physical. Me 'n Gwenda just about stopped and stared for a minute, trying to comprehend what the hell we were witnessing. If what we were lookin' at was even real.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The officers' bodycams show several robed, hooded figures standing in a circle, their hands raised as the wind howls around them. In frame are the bones of several animals littering the area, and various objects hang from the nearby trees in a circle. In other words, a cliche cult circle, complete with a ringleader standing above a corpse.</p>\n<p>The moment they catch their bearings, the duo draw their weapons and promptly jump into action. Startled, several of the figures flee into the woods at the sight of the officers, while several others seem to double over or clutch their heads. The leader, in the middle, is too preoccupied with their ritual to notice.</p>\n<p>Dalton and Cooper make quick work of the group. Within minutes, nearly all the suspects still present are safely in custody, all having gone willingly. Save for one, that is: the aforementioned cult leader, who only began to struggle as the pair moved to arrest them. The other officers, arriving minutes later, help take the group in. The other cultists, however, are long gone \u2014 a prospective manhunt is called off almost immediately due to the weather.</p>\n<p>Records on the suspects in custody are sparse. There is, however, a throughline between all the records that <em>are</em> public: the cultists either suffer from amnesia, or are all very good at pretending to. No one at the cult site \u2014 save for the leader, whose transcripts aren't anywhere I can find \u2014 could remember why they were there, or what they were trying to do.</p>\n<p>The leader was one Ms. Catherine Polley, a 25-year-old who lived in the area. I couldn't find anything particularly noteworthy about her life, though apparently she had been caught stealing signs from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_Post_Forest\">Sign Post Forest</a>, a local tourist trap, several weeks earlier. Similar \u2014 though heavily damaged \u2014 signs were found near the cult site. Besides that, though, all I could find was that she'd lived in the town her whole life, and apparently was an extremely bitter and spiteful person.</p>\n<p>All these details on their own would be eyebrow-raising. A mass hysteria case led by a vindictive psychopath or people strung too far in over their heads, perhaps, but not necessarily supernatural.</p>\n<p>What seals the deal for me is not the cultists. It's the body.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #f99\"><strong>crewtime</strong></span> 12/25/24 (WED) 14:22:08 #94926940</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>It took almost no time for the police to determine that the woman was dead. Her body sat lifelessly in the now-darkened center of the cult site, snow beginning to bury her limbs. With the lead suspect in custody and the weather potentially causing issues, the shift supervisor gave approval for the body to be transferred to a nearby morgue for analysis.</p>\n<p>The autopsy of the body took place on the 26th, after the holidays. Much to the surprise of the resident pathologist, no cause of death could be determined. There was no sign of physical injury (besides a broken wrist), blunt force trauma, toxicity buildup, or anything indicating foul play. Although hypothermia was the most likely cause of death, there was also nothing on the corpse that indicated death by exposure \u2014 save for some frostbite in the arms \u2014 and it seemed unlikely the cult would let her die naturally. The cause of death would ultimately be labeled as \"<tt>Unknown, likely hypothermia.</tt>\"</p>\n<p>What's even more mysterious is that, in the ensuing days, the woman could not be identified at all. Her DNA, fingerprints, and dental records did not match anyone in any known registry. No one interviewed in the region could identify her, nor had ever even seen her before. Even a vehicle found near the location of the kidnapping \u2014 believed to be owned by the victim \u2014 could not be traced to a specific owner.</p>\n<p>It was though she had simply materialized from thin air, for the sole purpose of being killed.</p>\n<p>At this point, records become practically non-existent. My best guess is that CSIS (Canada's FBI-equivalent) got involved and shut their investigation under a tight lock. That, unfortunately, gives us almost nothing to work with. Whether they're just as puzzled as us or have long solved the case, I have no idea. What I <em>do</em> know, though, is that within a week, every single outlet that had previously been following the story completely dropped it. Within a year, no one was talking about it anymore at all.</p>\n<p>My own efforts to unravel this mystery \u2014 or, at least, <em>write</em> about it \u2014 have been mostly fruitless. No missing persons cases across Canada or the US even remotely match her description. No one's come forward online claiming to have known her. Her car has no prior sightings or records associated with the license plate. Barely anyone even <em>mentions</em> the case anymore, even the content farms that pump out true crime stories. Dead end after dead end.</p>\n<p>Was she from a parallel universe? Was the cult? Did the cult's ritual somehow partially summon her into existence? Why? Is the government involved? Is the victim a foreign government agent, attempting to infiltrate some random Yukon town? Did <em>she</em> even know how she got there? Did the fact it happen on Christmas have anything to do with it at all?</p>\n<p>I have no idea. Truthfully, I don't think we'll ever really know. The whole thing reeks of conspiracy or a supernatural phenomenon. Whatever the case may be, we can only hope that she's at peace now, whoever she was.</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #f99\"><strong>crewtime</strong></span> 12/25/24 (WED) 14:25:29 #94926943</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>But that's not really a satisfying ending, and I wouldn't leave you all with nothing of substance to chew on.</p>\n<p>About a year after I initially shelved this post, a friend of mine \u2014 who wishes to remain anonymous \u2014 told me they were taking a trip through the Yukon. I remembered this case, and asked them if they'd do some ground research for me. They said yes.</p>\n<p>I wish I could say they cracked the case open, but all I've got is more questions. Still, I think the questions are different enough to make this case worth sharing now.</p>\n<p>To start off, some newspaper clippings in the local library reveal the ultimate fate of Ms. Polley: first-degree murder, kidnapping, and property theft charges, incurring a life sentence. That feels a little overkill to me personally, especially since we don't even know who the victim is or how she died. But, I'm not Canadian, so who can say.</p>\n<p>Her current whereabouts are unknown, though presumably she's behind bars.</p>\n<p>A different clipping \u2014 buried deep in the library's archives \u2014 reveals more about the cult site itself, though I don't know how much it illuminates. There were several urns containing ground-up bones, crow feathers, and other cult-adjacent items. There was a single burnt Polaroid, though it was too damaged to be legible.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most baffling, though, were several license plates, road signs, and other similar landmark items stolen from the aforementioned Sign Post Forest, scattered around the area. All of them seem to have had the names of places they were from removed, almost seamlessly. No clue what to make of that, personally.</p>\n<p>After that, my friend didn't seem to make much further progress. Asking the townsfolk was mostly a dead end; no one knew anything more than we did, in spite of the fact that it happened in that very same town.</p>\n<p>There was still one more lead that we wanted to follow through on, though: Laura Chance is still alive. She lives in the same three bedroom home, alone, twenty-five years later. She is currently eighty-seven, though is \u2014 from what I'm told \u2014 in relatively good health.</p>\n<p>When they met, she invited my friend inside for tea, and they had a pleasant chat. I have a recording of the conversation. While I don't think all of it is particularly pertinent \u2014 Mrs. Chance only had a passing role in the whole affair, after all \u2014 I do think there was one particular comment that caught my eye. I'll leave it off on this note.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Hm. After everything\u2026 I still don't know what to make of it, honestly. But I can tell you, my life's been emptier ever since it happened. I think seeing it on Christmas must've drained all the optimism out of me. A young girl pulled to her death right in front of my home, only years after my husband's passing\u2026 it hurt a fundamental part of my soul, I think.</em></p>\n<p><em>A few days after the whole affair, the police came to ask me a couple of questions. I don't remember everything they said to me \u2014 I was just in so much shock \u2014 but\u2026 they showed me a picture of her face, and asked me, and I quote, \"do you recognize her?\". And as soon as I saw it, I just started breaking down, sobbing uncontrollably.</em></p>\n<p><em>In all honesty\u2026 I</em> still <em>don't know why, all these years later. I had never seen her before in my life.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/the-cold-cult-of-the-yukon\">The Cold Cult of The Yukon</a>\" by Yossipossi, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

In other words, a cliche cult circle, complete with a ringleader standing above a corpse.\n\n\n\nThe moment they catch their bearings, the duo draw their weapons and promptly jump into action. Startled, several of the figures flee into the woods at the sight of the officers, while several others seem to double over or clutch their heads. The leader, in the middle, is too preoccupied with their ritual to notice.\n\n\n\nDalton and Cooper make quick work of the group. Within minutes, nearly all the suspects still present are safely in custody, all having gone willingly. Save for one, that is: the aforementioned cult leader, who only began to struggle as the pair moved to arrest them. The other officers, arriving minutes later, help take the group in. The other cultists, however, are long gone \u2014 a prospective manhunt is called off almost immediately due to the weather.\n\n\n\nRecords on the suspects in custody are sparse. There is, however, a throughline between all the records that //are// public: the cultists either suffer from amnesia, or are all very good at pretending to. No one at the cult site \u2014 save for the leader, whose transcripts aren't anywhere I can find \u2014 could remember why they were there, or what they were trying to do. \n\n\n\nThe leader was one Ms. Catherine Polley, a 25-year-old who lived in the area. I couldn't find anything particularly noteworthy about her life, though apparently she had been caught stealing signs from the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_Post_Forest Sign Post Forest], a local tourist trap, several weeks earlier. Similar \u2014 though heavily damaged \u2014 signs were found near the cult site. Besides that, though, all I could find was that she'd lived in the town her whole life, and apparently was an extremely bitter and spiteful person.\n\n\n\nAll these details on their own would be eyebrow-raising. A mass hysteria case led by a vindictive psychopath or people strung too far in over their heads, perhaps, but not necessarily supernatural. \n\n\n\nWhat seals the deal for me is not the cultists. It's the body.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n##f99|**crewtime**## 12/25/24 (WED) 14:22:08 #94926940\n\n----\n\n\n\nIt took almost no time for the police to determine that the woman was dead. Her body sat lifelessly in the now-darkened center of the cult site, snow beginning to bury her limbs. With the lead suspect in custody and the weather potentially causing issues, the shift supervisor gave approval for the body to be transferred to a nearby morgue for analysis. \n\n\n\nThe autopsy of the body took place on the 26th, after the holidays. Much to the surprise of the resident pathologist, no cause of death could be determined. There was no sign of physical injury (besides a broken wrist), blunt force trauma, toxicity buildup, or anything indicating foul play. Although hypothermia was the most likely cause of death, there was also nothing on the corpse that indicated death by exposure \u2014 save for some frostbite in the arms \u2014 and it seemed unlikely the cult would let her die naturally. The cause of death would ultimately be labeled as \"{{Unknown, likely hypothermia.}}\"\n\n\n\nWhat's even more mysterious is that, in the ensuing days, the woman could not be identified at all. Her DNA, fingerprints, and dental records did not match anyone in any known registry. No one interviewed in the region could identify her, nor had ever even seen her before. Even a vehicle found near the location of the kidnapping \u2014 believed to be owned by the victim \u2014 could not be traced to a specific owner. \n\n\n\nIt was though she had simply materialized from thin air, for the sole purpose of being killed.\n\n\n\nAt this point, records become practically non-existent. My best guess is that CSIS (Canada's FBI-equivalent) got involved and shut their investigation under a tight lock. That, unfortunately, gives us almost nothing to work with. Whether they're just as puzzled as us or have long solved the case, I have no idea. What I //do// know, though, is that within a week, every single outlet that had previously been following the story completely dropped it. Within a year, no one was talking about it anymore at all.\n\n\n\nMy own efforts to unravel this mystery \u2014 or, at least, //write// about it \u2014 have been mostly fruitless. No missing persons cases across Canada or the US even remotely match her description. No one's come forward online claiming to have known her. Her car has no prior sightings or records associated with the license plate. Barely anyone even //mentions// the case anymore, even the content farms that pump out true crime stories. Dead end after dead end.\n\n\n\nWas she from a parallel universe? Was the cult? Did the cult's ritual somehow partially summon her into existence? Why? Is the government involved? Is the victim a foreign government agent, attempting to infiltrate some random Yukon town? Did //she// even know how she got there? Did the fact it happen on Christmas have anything to do with it at all?\n\n\n\nI have no idea. Truthfully, I don't think we'll ever really know. The whole thing reeks of conspiracy or a supernatural phenomenon. Whatever the case may be, we can only hope that she's at peace now, whoever she was.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n##f99|**crewtime**## 12/25/24 (WED) 14:25:29 #94926943\n\n----\n\n\n\nBut that's not really a satisfying ending, and I wouldn't leave you all with nothing of substance to chew on.\n\n\n\nAbout a year after I initially shelved this post, a friend of mine \u2014 who wishes to remain anonymous \u2014 told me they were taking a trip through the Yukon. I remembered this case, and asked them if they'd do some ground research for me. They said yes.\n\n\n\nI wish I could say they cracked the case open, but all I've got is more questions. Still, I think the questions are different enough to make this case worth sharing now.\n\n\n\nTo start off, some newspaper clippings in the local library reveal the ultimate fate of Ms. Polley: first-degree murder, kidnapping, and property theft charges, incurring a life sentence. That feels a little overkill to me personally, especially since we don't even know who the victim is or how she died. But, I'm not Canadian, so who can say. \n\n\n\nHer current whereabouts are unknown, though presumably she's behind bars.\n\n\n\nA different clipping \u2014 buried deep in the library's archives \u2014 reveals more about the cult site itself, though I don't know how much it illuminates. There were several urns containing ground-up bones, crow feathers, and other cult-adjacent items. There was a single burnt Polaroid, though it was too damaged to be legible.\n\n\n\nPerhaps most baffling, though, were several license plates, road signs, and other similar landmark items stolen from the aforementioned Sign Post Forest, scattered around the area. All of them seem to have had the names of places they were from removed, almost seamlessly. No clue what to make of that, personally.\n\n\n\nAfter that, my friend didn't seem to make much further progress. Asking the townsfolk was mostly a dead end; no one knew anything more than we did, in spite of the fact that it happened in that very same town. \n\n\n\nThere was still one more lead that we wanted to follow through on, though: Laura Chance is still alive. She lives in the same three bedroom home, alone, twenty-five years later. She is currently eighty-seven, though is \u2014 from what I'm told \u2014 in relatively good health.\n\n\n\nWhen they met, she invited my friend inside for tea, and they had a pleasant chat. I have a recording of the conversation. While I don't think all of it is particularly pertinent \u2014 Mrs. Chance only had a passing role in the whole affair, after all \u2014 I do think there was one particular comment that caught my eye. I'll leave it off on this note.\n\n\n\n> //Hm. After everything... I still don't know what to make of it, honestly. But I can tell you, my life's been emptier ever since it happened. I think seeing it on Christmas must've drained all the optimism out of me. A young girl pulled to her death right in front of my home, only years after my husband's passing... it hurt a fundamental part of my soul, I think.//\n\n> \n\n> //A few days after the whole affair, the police came to ask me a couple of questions. I don't remember everything they said to me \u2014 I was just in so much shock \u2014 but... they showed me a picture of her face, and asked me, and I quote, \"do you recognize her?\". And as soon as I saw it, I just started breaking down, sobbing uncontrollably.//\n\n> \n\n> //In all honesty... I// still //don't know why, all these years later. I had never seen her before in my life.// \n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n> **Filename:** night.mp3\n\n> **Name:** Scent of Night - Myuu \n\n> **Author:** Myuu\n\n> **License:** \"Royalty-Free Music | Just give credit\"\n\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ma3BFoEwjPI Youtube]\n\n> **Additional Notes:** Audio file repeats track four times.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "art-exchange", "audio", "christmas", "creepypasta", "crime-fiction", "mystery", "parawatch", "tale"], "title": "The Cold Cult of The Yukon - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-cold-cult-of-the-yukon", "year": 2025}, "the-gray-tide": {"created_at": "2025-01-08T02:45:00", "creator": "Intercedent", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Intercedent", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/intercedent", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-08T02:45:00"}, {"author": "Intercedent", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/intercedent", "comment": "Added tags: bleak, end-of-death, horror, tale.

In the past years, the buildup of filth in Pierre had been getting worse and worse, and the SCP Foundation had procured a lucrative contract with the city to clean it up.</p>\n<p>The janitors themselves, however, were not as pleased with this. The carcass's decaying flesh stank to high hell, and its exposed bones jutted out at awkward angles. Dee stared at it with disgust, and they could've sworn it was staring back with its empty eyes. It was fascinating, in a morbid sort of way.</p>\n<p>\"What the hell is this thing doing here anyway? Why would there be a <em>sea</em> monster in a <em>lake</em>?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, whatever it is, I want it gone by the hour. Dee, Gears, get shoveling.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmph,\" Dee grumbled. \"This is absolutely <em>disgusting</em>.\" They pulled out their shovel and turned to Gears, when they heard a growl from behind them.</p>\n<p>\"Moose, was that your stomach? I told you not to skip lunch!\"</p>\n<p>Moose was not behind them, as they had gone to the truck to get their custom-made fifteen-foot-long plastic bag for the dead behemoth. The only thing that <em>was</em> behind Dee was the massive animal's corpse, flies buzzing around it. Dee looked closer and realized that it had moved. <em>No\u2014 it couldn't have. It's just some dead animal,</em> they thought. <em>Did it?</em></p>\n<p>\"Hey, Gears, did you see that?\"</p>\n<p>\"What are you referring to?\" Gears responded. He was staring blankly out at the lake, avoiding eye contact with the carcass.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026Never mind. Just help me get rid of this mess so we can get out of here.\"</p>\n<p>\"Right. I suppose I should be taking notes.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color: green\"><strong>Safe Cleanup Protocol:</strong> Object must be cleaned up as soon as possible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: green\"><strong>Description:</strong> Object is a large, vaguely reptile-like creature of unknown origin.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"It's dead. Put that it's dead,\" Moose said, peering over Gears' shoulder, having returned with a sizable plastic bag.</p>\n<p>\"Are we <em>sure</em> it's dead?\" Dee asked, nervously looking over at the carcass. Its fin-like limbs were sprawled out on the sand, a mop of decaying flesh covered its skull, and blood dripped from its maw onto the mud below. Dee could taste the stench of its fly-swarmed intestines in their mouth.</p>\n<p>\"I didn't include that information for a reason. Having been employed at the Foundation for three years, one's expectations may not necessarily align with reality when it comes to cleaning operations,\" Gears remarked.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, don't be silly, guys,\" Moose replied, putting their disposable gloves on. \"It may look creepy but it really is just some dead animal. Now, let's get shoveling,\"</p>\n<p>With that, the three got to work, using their shovels to scoop up mounds of creature's flesh, and heaving it into the bag. Dee wondered how they would transport the remains back to Site 19, given that it weighed over two thousand pounds. The repugnant stench emanating from the pile of rotting flesh filled the air, only made worse by humid the August heat. Dee could feel the sliminess of the dead animal's fatty tissue through their gloves, which when stepped on produced a sickening <em>squelch.</em> Moose, too, loathed every bit of this cleanup job, though as the boss they had to retain their composure as the three shoveled heaps of bones and tendons into the bag. Gears was the most calm; of the three, he had been a Safe Cleanup Professional the longest, and as a result he was used to these things. Nonetheless, he too had reservations about this job, though they didn't inhibit his work ethic.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the next hour, the plastic bag continued to fill with decaying tissue as the three toiled away in the late summer heat. It was as Dee was shoveling in a particularly sticky clump of sinew and bone that they heard a bellowing come from the creature's mouth.</p>\n<p>\"Uh, Moose? Gears?

The three janitors retreated slowly from the grotesque spectacle; the plastic bag came apart at the seams, with bony claws tearing through the polyester and writhing about in the open summer air. The groaning of the fallen behemoth drew in air to colossal, decaying lungs with a dreadful moan that made Dee wince; still, they were frozen in horror as they gazed upon their hard work unwrapping itself like a burrito of flesh and tissue.

In the past years, the buildup of filth in Pierre had been getting worse and worse, and the SCP Foundation had procured a lucrative contract with the city to clean it up. \n\n\n\nThe janitors themselves, however, were not as pleased with this. The carcass's decaying flesh stank to high hell, and its exposed bones jutted out at awkward angles. Dee stared at it with disgust, and they could've sworn it was staring back with its empty eyes. It was fascinating, in a morbid sort of way.\n\n\n\n\"What the hell is this thing doing here anyway? Why would there be a //sea// monster in a //lake//?\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, whatever it is, I want it gone by the hour. Dee, Gears, get shoveling.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hmph,\" Dee grumbled. \"This is absolutely //disgusting//.\" They pulled out their shovel and turned to Gears, when they heard a growl from behind them.\n\n\n\n\"Moose, was that your stomach? I told you not to skip lunch!\"\n\n\n\nMoose was not behind them, as they had gone to the truck to get their custom-made fifteen-foot-long plastic bag for the dead behemoth. The only thing that //was// behind Dee was the massive animal's corpse, flies buzzing around it. Dee looked closer and realized that it had moved. //No-- it couldn't have. It's just some dead animal,// they thought. //Did it?//\n\n\n\n\"Hey, Gears, did you see that?\"\n\n\n\n\"What are you referring to?\" Gears responded. He was staring blankly out at the lake, avoiding eye contact with the carcass.\n\n\n\n\"...Never mind. Just help me get rid of this mess so we can get out of here.\"\n\n\n\n\"Right. I suppose I should be taking notes.\"\n\n\n\n> ##green|**Safe Cleanup Protocol:** Object must be cleaned up as soon as possible.##\n\n> \n\n> ##green|**Description:** Object is a large, vaguely reptile-like creature of unknown origin.##\n\n\n\n\"It's dead. Put that it's dead,\" Moose said, peering over Gears' shoulder, having returned with a sizable plastic bag.\n\n\n\n\"Are we //sure// it's dead?\" Dee asked, nervously looking over at the carcass. Its fin-like limbs were sprawled out on the sand, a mop of decaying flesh covered its skull, and blood dripped from its maw onto the mud below. Dee could taste the stench of its fly-swarmed intestines in their mouth.\n\n\n\n\"I didn't include that information for a reason. Having been employed at the Foundation for three years, one's expectations may not necessarily align with reality when it comes to cleaning operations,\" Gears remarked.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, don't be silly, guys,\" Moose replied, putting their disposable gloves on. \"It may look creepy but it really is just some dead animal. Now, let's get shoveling,\"\n\n\n\nWith that, the three got to work, using their shovels to scoop up mounds of creature's flesh, and heaving it into the bag. Dee wondered how they would transport the remains back to Site 19, given that it weighed over two thousand pounds. The repugnant stench emanating from the pile of rotting flesh filled the air, only made worse by humid the August heat. Dee could feel the sliminess of the dead animal's fatty tissue through their gloves, which when stepped on produced a sickening //squelch.// Moose, too, loathed every bit of this cleanup job, though as the boss they had to retain their composure as the three shoveled heaps of bones and tendons into the bag. Gears was the most calm; of the three, he had been a Safe Cleanup Professional the longest, and as a result he was used to these things. Nonetheless, he too had reservations about this job, though they didn't inhibit his work ethic.\n\n\n\nOver the course of the next hour, the plastic bag continued to fill with decaying tissue as the three toiled away in the late summer heat. It was as Dee was shoveling in a particularly sticky clump of sinew and bone that they heard a bellowing come from the creature's mouth.\n\n\n\n\"Uh, Moose? Gears? You hear that?\"\n\n\n\nMoose looked up. \"Hmm?\"\n\n\n\n\"Did you not hear the creature growl? It's like\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\"Like it's still alive? \n\n\n\n\"Well, yeah.\"\n\n\n\nMoose rolled their eyes dismissively. \"Don't worry about it-- it was probably just air being released. Keep cleaning, we're almost done.\"\n\n\n\nThe last part of the remains that needed to be hauled into the bag was the head of the leviathan, which lay on the muddy ground connected to the rest of the body by strings of sinew and broken bones. The stench emanating from the creature's mouth made Dee regret having eaten lunch a couple hours prior.

I'll call the city and tell them we're done here.\" \n\n\n\nJust as Moose was about to dial in the number for the local authorities, the bag began to shake. \n\n\n\n\"What the fuck?\" exclaimed Dee.\n\n\n\n\"It appears our specimen may still have some life in it after all,\" Gears replied.\n\n\n\n\"Ew, shit, get away from it!\" Dee slowly backed away from the bag, which was twitching violently, shaking and rattling as if the lifeless remains of the creature were fighting to escape their prison.

He poured it over his face, scrubbing the filth away with his other hand. A torrent of water. A trickle. Only when the water stopped dripping did he toss the bottle into the chemical-stinking toilet and open his eyes.</p>\n<p>Eyes still stinging, he looked at his dirty reflection in the puddle on the floor and saw his five-year-old self inside.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Five-year-old Fritz turned away from the mirror. He heard whispers outside, blaming his father for keeping his focus on the bull and not making sure his son was all right. He crept out of the bathroom, hair still dripping and face still red from his lavations. He looked down at the bottle on the edge of the sink and anxiety crossed his face. He walked in the direction of the harness, clutching his father's water bottle the whole way.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>35-year old Fritz looked down into the chemical toilet. He reached his arm in up to the shoulder. Finally, he pulled out the sewage-filled bottle. It was old and thin plastic, covered in rictus cracks, never meant to last more than a day. He traced the seams in the duct tape that kept it together.</p>\n<p>Maybe it was just the port-a-potty fumes he was breathing, but Fritz felt an unmistakable connection to that day so many years ago.</p>\n<p>He went back through his mind's eye. The construction and demolition tools in his truck. The widths of the building's doors. The patterns of the Thing's movement. Never resolving until he looked, like Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\u2026</p>\n<p>And he pushed open the chemical toilet door, and closed his eyes.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Five-year-old Fritz crested the hill and stopped when he saw what his father was doing.</p>\n<p>Fred Williams placed his hand on the bull's nose. He whispered to it softly, caressing its head and flanks. Finally, he knelt back down, tilted back his head, and closed his eyes in a wide smile, as if offering an opportunity for a second kick.</p>\n<p>And the bull kicked Fred again. He fell back and cursed. The kick was made less by the harness, but it still hurt. Fritz rushed to him down the hill and offered him the water bottle.</p>\n<p>Fred took the water bottle, and, rubbing his own neck, offered it to the bull. The bull grasped it in its jaws. Water fell frothing from its mouth as it drank. At last it dropped the bottle and offered its hoof once more.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>35-year-old Fritz crawled through the abandoned building, his eyes firmly shut. He heard the scraping of concrete all around him. He continued his blind journey.</p>\n<p>Leaving the building, Fritz at last opened his eyes. He stumbled to his truck, opened the side compartments, and pulled out the hammer, the chisel, and the hose. He looked back at the door of the building. The Thing stood behind it, far too big to fit through. And deathly still.</p>\n<p>Fritz approached the Thing in the doorway. He ran his hand over its concrete hide and brushed away some of the caked effluence. Deep within it echoed a tremble.</p>\n<p>He told it what he was going to do, step by step. With the hose, he filled the bottle with clean water once more, and poured it over the Thing's clogged concrete pores. Again and again he did this, interspersing with a pressurized hose spray, until the water ran clean down its body.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Fred took back his knife and commenced carving the hoof again. He squeezed various areas until he heard pain, and then focused his carving there. His scraping uncovered a small hole from which stinking liquid sprayed out, and the bull groaned in relief, the pressure in the cavity finally relieved.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Fritz tapped his chisel all over the Thing until he felt it shudder, and began his chiseling there. It was tough work, and concrete dust flew out and up into his lungs, but a spray of the hose here and there helped it coagulate on the ground. He tapped into a cavity from which putrescence flowed, and rinsed it out. The shuddering of the concrete switched frequency; the rattling was now a purr.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Fred exposed the whole of the hoof-horn cavity to the light. The unnatural hollow could trap no more blood or mud where it could bother the bull. He made sure to leave enough horn on the outer edge to support the bull's weight, and he glued on a block to keep the weight off the sensitive hollow until the hoof grew back. When the glue had set, he released the bull from the harness and backed away.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow the neck injury he was ignoring would land him a several month stay in the hospital, worsened by the delay in treatment. Years from now his CTE from incidents like this would see Fritz crying over his deathbed.</p>\n<p>But not today.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Fritz exposed the whole of the concrete cavity to the light.
