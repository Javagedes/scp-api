He was rolling a blunt, as he often did, while wasting away in front of his computer.</p>\n<p>How pathetic.</p>\n<p>A thirty-something year old smoking weed in a dingy apartment, surrounded by empty energy drink cans and roaches. Truly king fuckshit on fuckshit mountain, sitting upon his throne of fuckshit. Fuck. Shit. He coughed. He wasn't even smoking and he was already coughing. This isn't good. He needed to see a doctor. When was the last time he had done that?</p>\n<p>Fuck. Not since he became who he was now. <em>Could</em> he even go to a doctor? The janitors were after him, and probably the feds too. He had killed a few people, and those types weren't ones to simply let that go. Fuck.</p>\n<p>No. Damn it, he shouldn't be cursing so much. He had told that twink at the dispensary that he was trying to cut down on swearing. <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Fuck</span>. Damn it. Ah, whatever, he was already going to hell. No number of <em>mea culpas</em> or Hail Marys could save his faggot tranny soul. Maybe if he went to mass more and stopped smoking as much, but alas, it was too late now.</p>\n<p>He sighed, finishing packing his blunt and bringing it up to his lips. He looked around for the shitty BIC lighter he had bought from the dispensary earlier, finding it behind his keyboard. Moments later, the blunt was lit and he was taking a deep drag from it. Smoke filled his lungs, and a violent, hacking cough took over his body, sending aches through his bones and muscles.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Fuck.</span> Damn it. He almost dropped the blunt. Though he doubted it would incinerate his apartment, there was always that danger. Or at least he thought so, being the paranoid <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">fucker</span> he was. In truth, the flame from the blunt was so dull, it was likely to merely singe the carpet beneath him at worst, but again, Jude was as pathetic as he was paranoid. And yet there he was, worried about the flames of hell.</p>\n<p>He exhaled, the smoke leaving his body in one fell swoop. Smoking had always helped him feel more at ease, but as of late, it was turning into something to fill time rather than a tool to relax. As if he deserved to relax. Surely someone as fucked up and evil as him didn't deserve anything more than suffering.</p>\n<p>After all, he had committed murder. The ultimate sin. Paired with his aforementioned sins, he truly felt wicked. He took another drag of his blunt, this time a smaller one. He didn't immediately break out into hacking coughs, so that was a bonus. He thought about his friends. Esther, JJ, bones, Faeowynn, Dahlia, Andressa, everyone else.</p>\n<p>How they looked up to him. It made him sick. He didn't deserve their friendship, much less their admiration. He was just a thirty-something year-old fuck up who spent his entire life stoned to cope with how much of a failure he was. Jude put out his blunt on the ashtray on his desk, then stashed the half-smoked reefer in his jeans pocket.</p>\n<p>He had something to do.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Hi.</p>\n<p>Yeah, me again.</p>\n<p>No, I don't want to buy any more.</p>\n<p>I was wondering what your return policy was?</p>\n<p>Yeah, the, uh, the weed.</p>\n<p>Yeah, I smoked some.</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p>Okay, yeah, that makes sense.</p>\n<p>Can I at least return the lighter?</p>\n<p>No, it's not broken.</p>\n<p>Okay.</p>\n<p>Actually, you know what?

The mode through which this instance was produced is unknown as the entity was currently not being observed, and was only noticed during routine inspection for containment purposes hours later. The new SCP-1213-1 instance was removed from the containment vessel at once and placed in the care of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for study.</p>\n<p>As is typical for Foundation sites during times of increased holiday energy, it is believed that this event is an example of immaculate conception, as SCP-1213 has not had access to other members of its original dimension in several years. However, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has suggested that this event may be completely natural, pointing out the lack of consensus on SCP-1213's reproductive biology. Further work is required before a full determination is made. However, the following addition to SCP-1213\u2019s file is requested in the meantime:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Description of SCP-1213-1:</strong> The recently observed SCP-1213-1 instance is a wooden and rubber catapult of similar design to the larger SCP-1213, although much smaller. Of note, the design of the SCP-1213 instance uses rubber bands as a launching mechanism in place of the steel fittings on SCP-1213, taking an appropriate form for its small size. As a result, the SCP-1213-1 instance has been placed into the care of Sector-25 researchers in order to conduct a longitudinal growth study of the entity to determine more about the biology of the SCP-1213 organism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/></div>\n<div class=\"footer-box\">\n<div class=\"bottom-left-box\">\n<div class=\"name-box\">Dr. Donatello \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</div>\n<div class=\"title-box\">Foundation Researcher (Sector-25)</div>\n<div class=\"sign-off-box\">Secure, Contain, Protect</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"attachment-box\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">*Open\u00a0email\u00a0attachment*</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Close</a></div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"dyna-email-container\">\n<div class=\"dyna-email\">\n<div class=\"header-box\">\n<div class=\"top-left-box cc-rchan7@scp.int\">\n<div class=\"from-box\">From:</div>\n<div class=\"to-box\">To:</div>\n<div class=\"cc-box cc-rchan7@scp.int\">CC:</div>\n<div class=\"subject-box\">Subject:</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"top-middle-box cc-rchan7@scp.int\">\n<div class=\"from-name-box\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">sector25_director@scp.int</span></div>\n<div class=\"to-name-box\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">dtjredacted@scp.int</span></div>\n<div class=\"cc-text-box cc-rchan7@scp.int\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">rchan7@scp.int</span></div>\n<div class=\"subject-text-box\">Re: Request of Addenda to be added to the SCP-1213 File</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"content-box\">\n<hr/>\n<p>Sounds good.

The new SCP-1213-1 instance was removed from the containment vessel at once and placed in the care of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for study. \n\n\n\nAs is typical for Foundation sites during times of increased holiday energy, it is believed that this event is an example of immaculate conception, as SCP-1213 has not had access to other members of its original dimension in several years. However, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has suggested that this event may be completely natural, pointing out the lack of consensus on SCP-1213's reproductive biology. Further work is required before a full determination is made. However, the following addition to SCP-1213\u2019s file is requested in the meantime:\n\n\n\n> **Description of SCP-1213-1:** The recently observed SCP-1213-1 instance is a wooden and rubber catapult of similar design to the larger SCP-1213, although much smaller. Of note, the design of the SCP-1213 instance uses rubber bands as a launching mechanism in place of the steel fittings on SCP-1213, taking an appropriate form for its small size. As a result, the SCP-1213-1 instance has been placed into the care of Sector-25 researchers in order to conduct a longitudinal growth study of the entity to determine more about the biology of the SCP-1213 organism.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:dynamic-emails\">:scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails</a> attachment-end=--\n\n|name= Dr. Donatello \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n|title= Foundation Researcher (Sector-25)\n\n|signoff= Secure, Contain, Protect\n\n|signoff-icon= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:dynamic-emails/Default_Profile_Icon.png\n\n|attachment= http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/launched-into-parenthood/SCP-1213-1.jpeg\n\n]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:dynamic-emails\">:scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails</a> start=--\n\n|from= sector25_director@scp.int\n\n|to= dtjredacted@scp.int\n\n|cc= rchan7@scp.int\n\n|subject= Re: Request of Addenda to be added to the SCP-1213 File\n\n\n\n]]\n\nSounds good.

During the procedure, junior researchers Smith and MacCallum both noted that each entity displayed unusually high levels of energy at identical times when placed near the connecting wall together. How they knew that the other was present on the other side of the wall is yet to be determined.\n\n\n\nDescriptions of Observed Behaviour Changes:\n\n|| Time || SCP-1213 || SCP-1213-1 ||\n\n|| 2:35 || Slight arm movement, side-to-side rocking || Jittering arm movement ||\n\n|| 3:10 || Rapid arm movement, \u201cbouncing\u201d rope || Rapid arm movement, jittering frame ||\n\n|| 3:20 || Rapid arm movement, \u201cbouncing\u201d rope, wheels spinning in place || Rapid arm movement, jittering frame ||\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:dynamic-emails\">:scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails</a> end=--\n\n|name= Dr. Donatello \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n|title= Foundation Researcher (Sector-25)\n\n|signoff= Secure, Contain, Protect\n\n|signoff-icon= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:dynamic-emails/Default_Profile_Icon.png\n\n]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:dynamic-emails\">:scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails</a> start=--\n\n|from= rchan7@scp.int\n\n|to= dtjredacted@scp.int\n\n|cc= sector25_director@scp.int\n\n|subject= Re:Re:Re: Request of Addenda to be added to the SCP-1213 File\n\n]]\n\nHello Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588,\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, your request is still pending due to a lack of rationale for inclusion of this information in the SCP-1213 file rather than creation of a separate file entirely. New combined-designation requirements are either that the entities are either contained together, containment of one requires containment of the other, or by director approval.\n\n\n\nPlease send me either approval from the Sector-25 director or evidence of a reason for combined-containment.\n\n\n\nWarm regards,\n\nDr. Rebecca Chan\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:dynamic-emails\">:scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails</a> end=--\n\n|name= Dr. Rebecca Chan\n\n|title= Foundation Researcher\n\n|signoff= Secure, Contain, Protect\n\n|signoff-icon= http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/launched-into-parenthood/drchan\n\n]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:dynamic-emails\">:scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails</a> start=--\n\n|from= dtjredacted@scp.int\n\n|to= rchan7@scp.int\n\n|cc= sector25_director@scp.int\n\n|subject= Re:Re:Re:Re: Request of Addenda to be added to the SCP-1213 File\n\n]]\n\nHello Dr. Chan,\n\n\n\nJim is currently on vacation so I will forward you the results of putting them together.\n\n\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:dynamic-emails\">:scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails</a> end=--\n\n|name= Dr. Donatello \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n|title= Foundation Researcher (Sector-25)\n\n|signoff= Secure, Contain, Protect\n\n|signoff-icon= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:dynamic-emails/Default_Profile_Icon.png\n\n]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:dynamic-emails\">:scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails</a> start=--\n\n|from= dtjredacted@scp.int\n\n|to= rchan7@scp.int\n\n|cc= sector25_director@scp.int\n\n|subject= Re:Re:Re:Re:Re: Request of Addenda to be added to the SCP-1213 File\n\n]]\n\nPlease disregard all prior requests to update the SCP-1213 file with information about SCP-1213-1\u2026\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:dynamic-emails\">:scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails</a> end=--\n\n|name= Dr. Donatello \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n|title= Foundation Researcher (Sector-25)\n\n|signoff= Secure, Contain, Protect\n\n|signoff-icon= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:dynamic-emails/Default_Profile_Icon.png\n\n]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:dynamic-emails\">:scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails</a> start=--\n\n|from= sector25_director@scp.int\u00a0\u00a0\n\n|to= dtjredacted@scp.int \n\n|cc= rchan7@scp.int\n\n|subject= Re:Re:Re:Re:Re: Request of Addenda to be added to the SCP-1213 File\n\n]]\n\nYou think?\n\n\n\nSee me first thing in my office on Monday to discuss why we don\u2019t rush testing procedures.\n\n\n\n-Jim\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:dynamic-emails\">:scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails</a> end=--\n\n|name= Dr. James Torres\n\n|title= Foundation Researcher and Director of Sector 25\n\n|signoff= Secure, Contain, Protect\n\n|signoff-icon= http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/launched-into-parenthood/drtorres\n\n]]\n\n\n\n++ Appended Record Outside of Primary Email Chain\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:dynamic-emails\">:scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails</a> start=--\n\n|from= TestingRoom13_donotreply@scp.int\n\n|to= dtjredacted@scp.int, rchan7@scp.int\n\n|cc= sector25_director@scp.int\n\n|subject= Recording from December 24 2024 at 10:12-10:15 in Sector-25 Testing Room 13\n\n]]\n\nThis is an automated message from the camera system located in Sector-25 Testing Room 13.
