The mode through which this instance was produced is unknown as the entity was currently not being observed, and was only noticed during routine inspection for containment purposes hours later. The new SCP-1213-1 instance was removed from the containment vessel at once and placed in the care of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for study.</p>\n<p>As is typical for Foundation sites during times of increased holiday energy, it is believed that this event is an example of immaculate conception, as SCP-1213 has not had access to other members of its original dimension in several years. However, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has suggested that this event may be completely natural, pointing out the lack of consensus on SCP-1213's reproductive biology. Further work is required before a full determination is made. However, the following addition to SCP-1213\u2019s file is requested in the meantime:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Description of SCP-1213-1:</strong> The recently observed SCP-1213-1 instance is a wooden and rubber catapult of similar design to the larger SCP-1213, although much smaller. Of note, the design of the SCP-1213 instance uses rubber bands as a launching mechanism in place of the steel fittings on SCP-1213, taking an appropriate form for its small size. As a result, the SCP-1213-1 instance has been placed into the care of Sector-25 researchers in order to conduct a longitudinal growth study of the entity to determine more about the biology of the SCP-1213 organism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"footer-box\">\n<div class=\"bottom-left-box\">\n<div class=\"name-box\">Dr. Donatello \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</div>\n<div class=\"title-box\">Foundation Researcher (Sector-25)</div>\n<div class=\"sign-off-box\">Secure, Contain, Protect</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"attachment-box\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">*Open\u00a0email\u00a0attachment*</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Close</a></div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"dyna-email-container\">\n<div class=\"dyna-email\">\n<div class=\"header-box\">\n<div class=\"top-left-box cc-rchan7@scp.int\">\n<div class=\"from-box\">From:</div>\n<div class=\"to-box\">To:</div>\n<div class=\"cc-box cc-rchan7@scp.int\">CC:</div>\n<div class=\"subject-box\">Subject:</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"top-middle-box cc-rchan7@scp.int\">\n<div class=\"from-name-box\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">sector25_director@scp.int</span></div>\n<div class=\"to-name-box\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">dtjredacted@scp.int</span></div>\n<div class=\"cc-text-box cc-rchan7@scp.int\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">rchan7@scp.int</span></div>\n<div class=\"subject-text-box\">Re: Request of Addenda to be added to the SCP-1213 File</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"content-box\">\n<hr/>\n<p>Sounds good.

The new SCP-1213-1 instance was removed from the containment vessel at once and placed in the care of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for study. \n\n\n\nAs is typical for Foundation sites during times of increased holiday energy, it is believed that this event is an example of immaculate conception, as SCP-1213 has not had access to other members of its original dimension in several years. However, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has suggested that this event may be completely natural, pointing out the lack of consensus on SCP-1213's reproductive biology. Further work is required before a full determination is made. However, the following addition to SCP-1213\u2019s file is requested in the meantime:\n\n\n\n> **Description of SCP-1213-1:** The recently observed SCP-1213-1 instance is a wooden and rubber catapult of similar design to the larger SCP-1213, although much smaller. Of note, the design of the SCP-1213 instance uses rubber bands as a launching mechanism in place of the steel fittings on SCP-1213, taking an appropriate form for its small size. As a result, the SCP-1213-1 instance has been placed into the care of Sector-25 researchers in order to conduct a longitudinal growth study of the entity to determine more about the biology of the SCP-1213 organism.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:dynamic-emails\">:scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails</a> attachment-end=--\n\n|name= Dr. Donatello \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n|title= Foundation Researcher (Sector-25)\n\n|signoff= Secure, Contain, Protect\n\n|signoff-icon= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:dynamic-emails/Default_Profile_Icon.png\n\n|attachment= http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/launched-into-parenthood/SCP-1213-1.jpeg\n\n]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:dynamic-emails\">:scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails</a> start=--\n\n|from= sector25_director@scp.int\n\n|to= dtjredacted@scp.int\n\n|cc= rchan7@scp.int\n\n|subject= Re: Request of Addenda to be added to the SCP-1213 File\n\n\n\n]]\n\nSounds good.

Taking place from 3100 BCE to 3000 BCE.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-2\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-2')\">2</a>. Uncertain translation and meaning, word seems to be compounded unusually from \u201clife\u201d, \u201csea\u201d and \u201cwater\u201d in the original text. Possible precursor to modern portmanteaus as seen in English and other Germanic descended languages.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-3\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-3')\">3</a>. Oral traditions throughout Finnfolk history have superstitiously assigned reproductive importance to only a single arm of most starfish species, even though, in actuality, they reproduce with all of them. It is currently unknown how deeply this belief persists in their modern, scientifically rigorous societies.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-4\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-4')\">4</a>. Five pearls as a cultural symbol seems to be present in most time periods of Finnfolk civilization. Modern iconography posits their significance similar to the romantic connotation of diamond rings in many areas of different human cultures, but it is uncertain if that same meaning is carried within this poem.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-5\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-5')\">5</a>. Fivefold repetition here and in other tercets of this poem suggest intentional anaphora instead of an accidental clustering of words, marking this poetic device as the earliest developed by pre-Mitheric Finnfolk, at least according to records known by the Foundation.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-6\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-6')\">6</a>. Most likely a precursor to the modern Finnfolk phrase \u201cof rocks, like starfish\u201d, roughly translating in meaning to \u201cthese two objects are closely related to each other in some manner, usually by virtue of physical characteristics\u201d, similar to the English idiom \u201clike father, like son\u201d. It is currently unknown why this connotation developed; the most likely explanation is the hard, calcified remains of dead starfish being likened to stones.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-7\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-7')\">7</a>. Uncertain translation. Literal translation is \u201clife carvings\u201d\u2014\u201ccarvings\u201d was translated to \u201cnames\u201d due to context clues and greater poetic impact.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-8\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-8')\">8</a>. Rhyming does not occur in the original translation; Finnfolk poetry did not express this trait until several decades after the First Sealing War\u2019s end.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-9\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-9')\">9</a>. Literal translation: \u201cfish which coughs slime\u201d.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-10\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-10')\">10</a>. Uncertain meaning; literal translation is \u201csecond sea beneath us\u201d. Most likely referring to the regular sky, but could also have greater theistic connotations. Currently, little is concretely known about whether pre-Mitheric Finnfolk believed in any kind of afterlife/higher plane of existence, or if their naturalistic beliefs lended themselves to believing that nature as it appeared to them existed instead as cycles of reincarnation and rebirth.</div>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:oceanbound\">:scp-wiki:theme:oceanbound</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:toggle-sidebar\">:scp-wiki:component:toggle-sidebar</a>]]\n\n====\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:preview\">component:preview</a>\n\ntext=\n\nDedicated to the most precious little ones.\n\n]]\n\n=====\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n[[module rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:author-label-source\">:scp-wiki:component:author-label-source</a> start=--\n\n|name=xexnoncores]]\n\nOf Starfish by [[*user xexnoncores]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:author-label-source\">:scp-wiki:component:author-label-source</a> end=--]]\n\n\n\n[[module CSS]]\n\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Prata&display=swap');\n\n\n\n.storybook {\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0font-family:Philosopher;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0font-size: 105%;\n\n}\n\n\n\n/*---- Toggle Sidebar compatibility patch ----*/\n\n#content-wrap {\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0grid-template-areas:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"deco\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"main\";\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0grid-template-columns: minmax(0, 1fr);\n\n}\n\n#main-content {\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0max-width: 47.5rem;\n\n}\n\n#side-bar { background-color: rgb(var(--foamy-white));

It is theorized to have been created before the First Sealing War[[footnote]]Taking place from 3100 BCE to 3000 BCE.[[/footnote]], with thaumic-dating placing its origins at around roughly 6100-5900 BCE. Most likely to be part of a poem, it is one of the oldest examples of Finnfolk language and culture before its shaping by Mitheric influences into the forms we know today. \n\n\n\nIf you are reading this and not familiar with typical lens of historical poetic analysis, it is advised to first contact Dr. Molly Hussie at Site-212A to check on the date of available workshops, then to read this poem once without footnotes, and again with them for the best experience.\n\n\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[div class=\"scenesetter\"]]\n\n[[span style=\"color: blue; font-family: Grenze Gotisch ; font-size: 1.25rem\"]]Count their arms: I shall give blessings for each\n\n\n\nOne stroke of my scales\n\n\n\nTwo liftings out of the life-water [[footnote]]Uncertain translation and meaning, word seems to be compounded unusually from \u201clife\u201d, \u201csea\u201d and \u201cwater\u201d in the original text.

It's just some dead animal,</em> they thought. <em>Did it?</em></p>\n<p>\"Hey, Gears, did you see that?\"</p>\n<p>\"What are you referring to?\" Gears responded.

Put that it's dead,\" Moose said, peering over Gears' shoulder, having returned with a sizable plastic bag.</p>\n<p>\"Are we <em>sure</em> it's dead?\" Dee asked, nervously looking over at the carcass. Its fin-like limbs were sprawled out on the sand, a mop of decaying flesh covered its skull, and blood dripped from its maw onto the mud below. Dee could taste the stench of its fly-swarmed intestines in their mouth.</p>\n<p>\"I didn't include that information for a reason. Having been employed at the Foundation for three years, one's expectations may not necessarily align with reality when it comes to cleaning operations,\" Gears remarked.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, don't be silly, guys,\" Moose replied, putting their disposable gloves on. \"It may look creepy but it really is just some dead animal. Now, let's get shoveling,\"</p>\n<p>With that, the three got to work, using their shovels to scoop up mounds of creature's flesh, and heaving it into the bag. Dee wondered how they would transport the remains back to Site 19, given that it weighed over two thousand pounds. The repugnant stench emanating from the pile of rotting flesh filled the air, only made worse by humid the August heat. Dee could feel the sliminess of the dead animal's fatty tissue through their gloves, which when stepped on produced a sickening <em>squelch.</em> Moose, too, loathed every bit of this cleanup job, though as the boss they had to retain their composure as the three shoveled heaps of bones and tendons into the bag. Gears was the most calm; of the three, he had been a Safe Cleanup Professional the longest, and as a result he was used to these things. Nonetheless, he too had reservations about this job, though they didn't inhibit his work ethic.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the next hour, the plastic bag continued to fill with decaying tissue as the three toiled away in the late summer heat. It was as Dee was shoveling in a particularly sticky clump of sinew and bone that they heard a bellowing come from the creature's mouth.</p>\n<p>\"Uh, Moose? Gears? You hear that?\"</p>\n<p>Moose looked up. \"Hmm?\"</p>\n<p>\"Did you not hear the creature growl? It's like\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Like it's still alive?</p>\n<p>\"Well, yeah.\"</p>\n<p>Moose rolled their eyes dismissively. \"Don't worry about it\u2014 it was probably just air being released. Keep cleaning, we're almost done.\"</p>\n<p>The last part of the remains that needed to be hauled into the bag was the head of the leviathan, which lay on the muddy ground connected to the rest of the body by strings of sinew and broken bones. The stench emanating from the creature's mouth made Dee regret having eaten lunch a couple hours prior. Nonetheless, ignoring the stink and the low growling that Moose was so sure was normal, Dee shoveled the last of it into the plastic bag, and Gears tied it shut.</p>\n<p>\"Alright, well done team,\" said Moose. \"Pat yourselves on the back\u2014 preferably after taking your gloves off. I'll call the city and tell them we're done here.\"</p>\n<p>Just as Moose was about to dial in the number for the local authorities, the bag began to shake.</p>\n<p>\"What the fuck?\" exclaimed Dee.</p>\n<p>\"It appears our specimen may still have some life in it after all,\" Gears replied.</p>\n<p>\"Ew, shit, get away from it!\" Dee slowly backed away from the bag, which was twitching violently, shaking and rattling as if the lifeless remains of the creature were fighting to escape their prison. The three janitors retreated slowly from the grotesque spectacle; the plastic bag came apart at the seams, with bony claws tearing through the polyester and writhing about in the open summer air. The groaning of the fallen behemoth drew in air to colossal, decaying lungs with a dreadful moan that made Dee wince; still, they were frozen in horror as they gazed upon their hard work unwrapping itself like a burrito of flesh and tissue. Slowly, the deceased leviathan rose, the muddy earth trembling as it did, with a malignant glimmer in its once-dead eyes.</p>\n<p>For a moment, the cleanup crew and the monster stared at one another in silence; Dee could feel their heart pounding in their chest, now faced with the living, breathing carcass. The reptilian creature's hollow eyes glinted yellow, its decrepit flesh dangling in a mop to the side of its skeletal head. The entire bony frame of the monster was held together by threadbare strands of tissue; flesh, meat, and bone all conglomerated together into a revolting, fifteen-foot abomination with a sickening appearance.</p>\n<p>The beast gave a low growl, and muttered a single word.</p>\n<p><span class=\"disgusting\"><em>\"Disgusting.\"</em></span></p>\n<p>The creature lunged at Dee first, snarling and snapping its jaws, nearly putting a gash into their stomach. Dee stumbled backwards, wielding their shovel in an attempt to defend themselves. The creature trundled towards them; Moose swung with their own shovel, missing entirely, before the creature snapped again. As the monster closed in on Dee, it gave a sickening roar, with spittle dripping from its mouth onto the muddy grass, melting it on contact. The creature reared up to take a bite out of its victim's stomach, when its jaws were slammed shut by Gears, who had rolled up his sleeves, ready to fight.</p>\n<p>\"Oh my god\u2014 thanks, Gears!\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't talk. Back away.\"</p>\n<p>The monster thrashed, swinging at Gears with its claws, and he released the animal just in time to avoid a nasty slash to his chest. Jaws dripping with rancid saliva, it lumbered slowly towards Moose next. They hit it squarely in the snout with their shovel, briefly disorienting the creature. Roaring, it pounced at Moose, but Gears was ready with his shovel again, sticking it between the animal's jaws. The creature clamped down on the shovel handle, snapping the wood in half.</p>\n<p>\"What are you guys doing? Run!\" Dee yelled, dragging Moose back to their feet. While the creature took a moment to swallow Gears' shovel, the three hastily retreated from the lakeside. As Dee turned back to take another look at the beast, they watched it rapidly shed its own skin, leaving behind a pile of atrophied flesh on the ground. The creature opened its mouth, and burped loudly.</p>\n<p>The creature snarled, and charged at the three janitors with unexpected speed. Dee, Moose, and Gears continued to sprint as fast as they possibly good, this time towards the road. Adrenaline filled their veins, and none dared look backward as the rhythmic thumping of scaly claws on the ground grew louder and closer.</p>\n<p>\"Left!\" Dee shouted as the three approached the roadside, narrowly avoiding the onslaught of traffic.</p>\n<p>The creature trampled towards them, crossing onto the road, with a roar louder than even the engines of the oncoming traffic. Cars swerved around the creature as it pursued the three, with many pulling over on the side of the road to take pictures of the gigantic lizard stomping down the lanes. The janitors running up the roadside could smell its rancid breath as it closed in, its jaws open wide and dripping with saliva.</p>\n<p><em>WHAM.</em></p>\n<p>A twenty-ton semi-truck had collided with the beast, sending the monster reeling onto its side.</p>\n<p>The big rig pulled over on the side of the road. A tall, burly man in a red baseball cap and a tank top climbed out of the driver's seat.</p>\n<p>\"Aw hell, was that your, uh, crocodile?\" he asked with concern.</p>\n<p>\"Uh, something like that,\" Moose replied.</p>\n<p>\"Sorry y'all, that one's on me.\"</p>\n<p>As cars swerved to avoid the massive incapacitated lake monster fallen on the side of the road, Gears inspected the fallen animal. \"It's down, but not out. I suggest we make haste,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"Name's Radcliffe Gerald.\" The truck driver extended a meaty hand to Moose, who shook his with their own, much skinnier fingers.</p>\n<p>\"I'm Tilda Moose. Safe Cleanup Professionals. We're trying to clean up after this animal. You\u2026 wouldn't happen to be currently employed, would you?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nope, still lookin' for\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Good, you're hired. Help us get this creature in the back of your truck.\"</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/the-lake-oahe-monster\">The Lake Oahe Monster</a>\" by ubergoober, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

I suppose I should be taking notes.\"\n\n\n\n> ##green|**Safe Cleanup Protocol:** Object must be cleaned up as soon as possible.##\n\n> \n\n> ##green|**Description:** Object is a large, vaguely reptile-like creature of unknown origin.##\n\n\n\n\"It's dead. Put that it's dead,\" Moose said, peering over Gears' shoulder, having returned with a sizable plastic bag.\n\n\n\n\"Are we //sure// it's dead?\" Dee asked, nervously looking over at the carcass. Its fin-like limbs were sprawled out on the sand, a mop of decaying flesh covered its skull, and blood dripped from its maw onto the mud below. Dee could taste the stench of its fly-swarmed intestines in their mouth.\n\n\n\n\"I didn't include that information for a reason. Having been employed at the Foundation for three years, one's expectations may not necessarily align with reality when it comes to cleaning operations,\" Gears remarked.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, don't be silly, guys,\" Moose replied, putting their disposable gloves on. \"It may look creepy but it really is just some dead animal. Now, let's get shoveling,\"\n\n\n\nWith that, the three got to work, using their shovels to scoop up mounds of creature's flesh, and heaving it into the bag. Dee wondered how they would transport the remains back to Site 19, given that it weighed over two thousand pounds. The repugnant stench emanating from the pile of rotting flesh filled the air, only made worse by humid the August heat. Dee could feel the sliminess of the dead animal's fatty tissue through their gloves, which when stepped on produced a sickening //squelch.// Moose, too, loathed every bit of this cleanup job, though as the boss they had to retain their composure as the three shoveled heaps of bones and tendons into the bag. Gears was the most calm; of the three, he had been a Safe Cleanup Professional the longest, and as a result he was used to these things. Nonetheless, he too had reservations about this job, though they didn't inhibit his work ethic.\n\n\n\nOver the course of the next hour, the plastic bag continued to fill with decaying tissue as the three toiled away in the late summer heat. It was as Dee was shoveling in a particularly sticky clump of sinew and bone that they heard a bellowing come from the creature's mouth.\n\n\n\n\"Uh, Moose? Gears? You hear that?\"\n\n\n\nMoose looked up. \"Hmm?\"\n\n\n\n\"Did you not hear the creature growl? It's like\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\"Like it's still alive? \n\n\n\n\"Well, yeah.\"\n\n\n\nMoose rolled their eyes dismissively. \"Don't worry about it-- it was probably just air being released. Keep cleaning, we're almost done.\"\n\n\n\nThe last part of the remains that needed to be hauled into the bag was the head of the leviathan, which lay on the muddy ground connected to the rest of the body by strings of sinew and broken bones. The stench emanating from the creature's mouth made Dee regret having eaten lunch a couple hours prior. Nonetheless, ignoring the stink and the low growling that Moose was so sure was normal, Dee shoveled the last of it into the plastic bag, and Gears tied it shut.\n\n\n\n\"Alright, well done team,\" said Moose. \"Pat yourselves on the back-- preferably after taking your gloves off. I'll call the city and tell them we're done here.\" \n\n\n\nJust as Moose was about to dial in the number for the local authorities, the bag began to shake. \n\n\n\n\"What the fuck?\" exclaimed Dee.\n\n\n\n\"It appears our specimen may still have some life in it after all,\" Gears replied.\n\n\n\n\"Ew, shit, get away from it!\" Dee slowly backed away from the bag, which was twitching violently, shaking and rattling as if the lifeless remains of the creature were fighting to escape their prison. The three janitors retreated slowly from the grotesque spectacle; the plastic bag came apart at the seams, with bony claws tearing through the polyester and writhing about in the open summer air. The groaning of the fallen behemoth drew in air to colossal, decaying lungs with a dreadful moan that made Dee wince; still, they were frozen in horror as they gazed upon their hard work unwrapping itself like a burrito of flesh and tissue. Slowly, the deceased leviathan rose, the muddy earth trembling as it did, with\u00a0\u00a0a malignant glimmer in its once-dead eyes.\n\n\n\nFor a moment, the cleanup crew and the monster stared at one another in silence; Dee could feel their heart pounding in their chest, now faced with the living, breathing carcass. The reptilian creature's hollow eyes glinted yellow, its decrepit flesh dangling in a mop to the side of its skeletal head. The entire bony frame of the monster was held together by threadbare strands of tissue; flesh, meat, and bone all conglomerated together into a revolting, fifteen-foot abomination with a sickening appearance.\n\n\n\nThe beast gave a low growl, and muttered a single word.\n\n\n\n[[span class=\"disgusting\"]]//\"Disgusting.\"//[[/span]]\n\n\n\nThe creature lunged at Dee first, snarling and snapping its jaws, nearly putting a gash into their stomach. Dee stumbled backwards, wielding their shovel in an attempt to defend themselves. The creature trundled towards them; Moose swung with their own shovel, missing entirely, before the creature snapped again. As the monster closed in on Dee, it gave a sickening roar, with spittle dripping from its mouth onto the muddy grass, melting it on contact. The creature reared up to take a bite out of its victim's stomach, when its jaws were slammed shut by Gears, who had rolled up his sleeves, ready to fight.\n\n\n\n\"Oh my god-- thanks, Gears!\"\n\n\n\n\"Don't talk. Back away.\"\n\n\n\nThe monster thrashed, swinging at Gears with its claws, and he released the animal just in time to avoid a nasty slash to his chest. Jaws dripping with rancid saliva, it lumbered slowly towards Moose next. They hit it squarely in the snout with their shovel, briefly disorienting the creature. Roaring, it pounced at Moose, but Gears was ready with his shovel again, sticking it between the animal's jaws. The creature clamped down on the shovel handle, snapping the wood in half.\n\n\n\n\"What are you guys doing? Run!\" Dee yelled, dragging Moose back to their feet. While the creature took a moment to swallow Gears' shovel, the three hastily retreated from the lakeside. As Dee turned back to take another look at the beast, they watched it rapidly shed its own skin, leaving behind a pile of atrophied flesh on the ground. The creature opened its mouth, and burped loudly.\n\n\n\nThe creature snarled, and charged at the three janitors with unexpected speed. Dee, Moose, and Gears continued to sprint as fast as they possibly good, this time towards the road. Adrenaline filled their veins, and none dared look backward as the rhythmic thumping of scaly claws on the ground grew louder and closer.\n\n\n\n\"Left!\" Dee shouted as the three approached the roadside, narrowly avoiding the onslaught of traffic.\n\n\n\nThe creature trampled towards them, crossing onto the road, with a roar louder than even the engines of the oncoming traffic. Cars swerved around the creature as it pursued the three, with many pulling over on the side of the road to take pictures of the gigantic lizard stomping down the lanes. The janitors running up the roadside could smell its rancid breath as it closed in, its jaws open wide and dripping with saliva.\n\n\n\n//WHAM.//\n\n\n\nA twenty-ton semi-truck had collided with the beast, sending the monster reeling onto its side. \n\n\n\nThe big rig pulled over on the side of the road. A tall, burly man in a red baseball cap and a tank top climbed out of the driver's seat.\n\n\n\n\"Aw hell, was that your, uh, crocodile?\" he asked with concern.\n\n\n\n\"Uh, something like that,\" Moose replied. \n\n\n\n\"Sorry y'all, that one's on me.\"\n\n\n\nAs cars swerved to avoid the massive incapacitated lake monster fallen on the side of the road, Gears inspected the fallen animal. \"It's down, but not out. I suggest we make haste,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"Name's Radcliffe Gerald.\" The truck driver extended a meaty hand to Moose, who shook his with their own, much skinnier fingers. \n\n\n\n\"I'm Tilda Moose. Safe Cleanup Professionals. We're trying to clean up after this animal. You... wouldn't happen to be currently employed, would you?\"\n\n\n\n\"Nope, still lookin' for\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\"Good, you're hired. Help us get this creature in the back of your truck.\"\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["biweekly", "site-19-dossier", "welcome-to-site-19", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["comedy", "director-moose", "doctor-gears", "doctor-gerald", "hard-to-destroy-reptile", "tale"], "title": "The Lake Oahe Monster - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-lake-oahe-monster", "year": 2025}}
