High, whitewashed walls lined with pillars and neat blue shutters for the windows smiled at him as he inched the clanking van emblazoned with the words SAFE CLEANUP PROFESSIONALS down the driveway in the early morning sun.</p>\n<p>Apparently, Mr. Fernand was a gourmand who hosted parties around town that often left quite a mess \u2014 a mess that only the Foundation was willing to clean up. His mentor, Dee, had told him all the new guys had to do it at least once. Beau didn't mind. If Mr. Fernand hung out in fancy houses like this, he'd clean with a smile on his face. Here, in the wealthy suburbs of Pierre, the stillness of <em>some</em> isolation blocked out the noise from the world outside. It was truly peaceful and as Beau approached the front door, he found himself smiling.</p>\n<p>As Beau ascended the stairs to the door on the chilly morning, he noticed it stood slightly ajar. He froze, staring for a second, wondering why anyone would be so silly. It was freezing and all this cold air wasn't going to be good for a person. At least, that's what his gran had told him. Getting closer, he couldn't help but notice the red fingerprints smeared on the door. He peered at them closely, wondering what it was going to take to get that off.</p>\n<p>After a second of considering the problem in front of him, he realised he was being watched from deeper in the house. A looming shadow from the top of the stairs peered down at him and Beau took it as his cue.</p>\n<p>\"Hello?\" Beau said uncertainly. \"This is Beau from the cleaning agency. SCP - Cleanliness Guaranteed!\"</p>\n<p>Thundering footsteps approached the door hurriedly and Beau's stomach knotted, waiting for him to be told he had the wrong house and that he was going to get melted by an old god if he didn't leave immediately. As the door swung open, though, Mr. Fernand beamed down at him from his towering full height. His wide, lopsided mouth approximated a smile, a smile Beau couldn't help but return. Happy clients were always a joy, especially if they were smiling before he even started.</p>\n<p>\"My good friend!\" Mr. Fernand spoke in reedy, heavily-accented English and stood back to let him into the entrance hall. It was a little cramped, but the light from the window above the door bathed the room in a welcoming warmth. The smudges on the floor were going to be a nightmare to deal with, but he was getting the idea it was the least of his worries. \"It is so good of you to come out on such short notice. Usually I schedule things more comfortably, but last night's affair was so short notice, I didn't have a chance to set anything up with the agency. Thank you so much for your time.\"</p>\n<p>\"Not at all!\" Beau chuckled. \"This is way better than the whale my colleagues have to go scrape up this morning. A dinner party, I can deal with.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's more the prep for the dinner party that needs to get cleaned up,\" Mr. Fernand explained, indicating for Beau to follow as he disappeared into the adjoining living room. \"We had venison and I was preparing the elk and let's just say it got messy. The garage and dining room are going to need some proper work. Don't mind the smudges. There was quite a sticky basting sauce.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's not a problem. It's what I'm here for. You'll just need to show me the area of biggest concern for you right now.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sure, sure!\" said Mr. Fernand. \"I'll be happy to.\"</p>\n<p>\"Also, may I say, nice cravat?\" Beau said, his eye catching another broad smear along a wall.</p>\n<p>\"Oh! You like it? It was a gift from the Prince of Venezuela! We met last week for his birthday and he just handed it to me. What was I to do, say no?\" Mr. Fernand tutted. \"Of course, not.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, that you're totally right. You can't look a gift like that in the mouth. The Prince would have been angry.\"</p>\n<p>Mr. Fernand didn't stop nattering about the Prince as he led the way through the elegant home. Beau was there to work though, so as much as he was getting lost in the tales Fernand was telling, he made sure to keep scanning the space for marks. There were a lot of them. Fernand's guests, whoever they were, had thoroughly enjoyed their dinner, it seemed.</p>\n<p>A loud thud from upstairs stopped them in their tracks. Mr. Fernand's eyes shot towards the staircase, his ear cocked, listening closely.</p>\n<p>\"Is everything okay?\" Beau asked.</p>\n<p>\"Yes. The dog is just being naughty again.\" Fernand said, his expression relaxing before he slowly nodded and carried on leading the way, satisfied the dog had gone quiet.</p>\n<p>\"What breed are they?\"</p>\n<p>\"Chihuahua,\" said Fernand and signaled for Beau to follow. \"Come. I'll show you where the party starts.\"</p>\n<p>Beau dutifully followed, but he was pretty sure he was getting the idea of what waited for him in the garage from last night's debris scattered about. The kitchen was a mess of blood and viscera \u2014 looked like lungs, to be specific \u2014 marring the sink, stove and counter space. Fernand, to his credit, seemed at least a little embarrassed at the state of the place and Beau wondered if he'd need to call in Dee to help with this one. It was still early, he reminded himself; there would be enough time.</p>\n<p>\"So as part of my show for the guests, I start in here,\" Fernand said, leading the way into the wide garage down a path lined with flowerbeds waiting for spring. \"This is where I gut and clean the animal for the guests. Of course, I keep the killing of the animal for before. It becomes problematic to serve dinner once your guests are emotionally invested in the meal, so to speak.\"</p>\n<p>\"Whoa!\" said Beau as he stepped in to find yet more viscera and blood centered around a stainless steel hook hanging in the center of the room. Unlike the kitchen, there was no control to this mess. Somehow, Fernand had got bits of his pre-cooked dinner on the roof, on the walls and on the floor. \"This is so interactive!\"</p>\n<p>\"You understand!\" Fernand clapped his hands together, delighted. \"I honestly just like putting on a show for my guests and having them choose the parts they'll be eating draws them so much closer to the experience, don't you think?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, that sounds pretty immersive, alright!\" Beau smiled, turning to regard the garage. \"I'm going to need to get started, though. It wasn't just your guests that were immersed last night.\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course! Of course! Let me get out of your way! If you need anything, anything at all, I'm just upstairs.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thanks a lot! And it's just in here, the kitchen and dining room, right?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh yes, the housekeeper comes on Monday, but there's just no way I was going to call her in for this,\" he said and a grin spread across his face. \"She doesn't quite have the stomach for my parties.\"</p>\n<p>A long silence hung between them as Fernand's eyes traced lines across Beau's face. But Beau quickly began to feel the weight of his backpack and dumped it on the ground and brightly said, \"Well, I better get to work!\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>In the words of Mister Fritz Diedrich Williams, Administrator of the Safe Cleanup Professionals Foundation, \"An SCProfessional's best friend is soap, water and <em>elbow grease!</em> Get scrubbing.\"</p>\n<p>So that's what Beau did. He took a quick sweep of the mess of the house and gathered what he could. Fortunately, Mr. Fernand had put most of the leftovers away already, and Beau had to admit, the crackling looked pretty good. Here and there, the streaks of a cloth made from a shirt that now sat crusted and dried on the edge of the sink told Beau that Mr. Fernand had probably tried to clean up himself before giving up. He couldn't help but chuckle. Some people just needed that extra bit of help, and from how hard Fernand was clenching his jaw, this was all probably pretty overwhelming for him.</p>\n<p>\"Eat shit, Dee,\" he said, dropping the last of some bones, marrow sucked clean, into the trash and heading for the oozing lungs in the sink. \"This is way better than whale clean-up.\"</p>\n<p>He clapped his hands free of dust and sticky sinew over the trashcan and took a deep breath before heading back to the van. The pressure hose was his favourite part and the set-up would take a minute. Of course, part of that set-up meant disappearing behind the garage to smoke a joint. There was no way he was going to be away from management's eyes and <em>not</em> have some fun. Besides, the garage was an abattoir after Fernand's performance art and getting stoned would only help him appreciate it more.</p>\n<p>Dee's weed harshed his throat more than he liked, but it was weed in South Dakota, so he really didn't have high expectations. He knew better than to have expectations at all. He'd learned the hard way.</p>\n<p>With a smile on his face and <em>Paper Planes</em> blaring in his ears, Beau set to work. SCP didn't do much fancy in the way of chemicals, from what he could tell. It really was just elbow grease and soap, he was pretty sure. He did get to meet interesting people like Mr. Fernand and knowing that werewolves actually <em>did</em> exist was pretty cool. Then again, he'd kind of always known it, but it was like a war on the other side of the world \u2014 out of sight, out of mind.</p>\n<p>The rhythmic scrape of the broom's hard bristles slowly scrubbed away Fernand's theatrics from the night before as the sun climbed higher in the sky. Beau had worked up a firm sweat despite the winter cold and was taking a break round back with more of his joint when a shadow from the house caught his attention.</p>\n<p>\"Shit!\" He hissed, stubbing the roach dead on the bottom of his shoe, trying to exhale what he could. He was confident Fernand wouldn't smell anything as he clambered out from behind the garage. \"Mr. Fernand, I'm so sorry! I was just taking a look out back to see if that may need attention. You know we have wonderful gardening services, too?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'll keep that in mind for the spring!\" Fernand said cheerily, casting his eyes towards the gaping maw of the garage and nodding. \"You're making very good progress. Fritz sure knows how to hire.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, but I just think the mess was pretty controlled, honestly.\" He wasn't a good liar, but what else was there to say? He didn't take compliments well. \"Just needs some elbow grease. I hope you don't mind, I moved the freezer. There was blood behind it that I wanted to get out.\"</p>\n<p>\"You moved the freezer?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, I'm pretty good at moving things.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see.\" Fernand's eyes moved between the freezer and Beau for a few seconds before he smiled widely again. \"That's wonderful news! You're very thorough and that is honestly so appreciated. Not enough people take pride in their work these days and it's that kind of dedication that will carry you far young man!\"</p>\n<p>\"You're too kind.\"</p>\n<p>\"Would you like some lemonade? All this work won't be good for you without a refreshment!\"</p>\n<p>\"That'd be \u2014\" A crash came from the nearby second floor window followed immediately by a loud yelp.</p>\n<p>\"That darn dog!\" Fernand snarled and then he set off with urgent steps towards the house before chiming over his shoulder. \"I'll be right back with your lemonade!\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you!\"</p>\n<p>Beau chuckled as he watched the behemoth of a man disappear into the house. He was busy putting his earphones back in, when suddenly a piercing shriek cut through the air from the house. Beau's head swiveled in the direction of the noise and he saw through the open window as Fernand stared down at a flailing mass of hair jittering from just below the window sill. Obviously his dog was quite excitable. Cold fury crossed Fernand's face and just as he looked like he was about to erupt, he saw Beau watching.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, Beau! I'm so sorry,\" he cried from through the window, stepping around the agitated animal. \"My dog seems to have gone potty on my rug. I'll have to handle this before I bring you that lemonade, but if you're really quite thirsty you can help yourself to some in the refrigerator.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sure thing, Mr. Fernand! Do you need help with that mess? It's kind of what I'm here for.\"</p>\n<p>\"No, no!\" Fernand said, hastily. \"You just listen to your music and keep busy there or you'll never get finished. It's just a small mess. I can handle this.\"</p>\n<p>Without another word, Fernand stepped back and drew the curtains closed with a flourish, which, Beau thought as he put his earphones back in, wasn't going to help with the smell. Especially considering how big that chihuahua was.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The dining room wasn't as bad as it could have been, Beau reckoned. If the prep areas were abattoirs, he had half expected the dining room to have food in places he didn't know were places. One thing he was worried about though was the piece of <em>something</em> that had somehow hit the roof and stayed there. He'd need to get that down, but that was a worry for later and so he turned his attention to the kitchen floors. With Single Ladies on repeat, he set to work.</p>\n<p>Mr. Fernand never did come back with that lemonade, but Beau just laughed it off. He was probably having a fit over some dog shit on some too-expensive rug. Thank God the downstairs had wooden floors. He could stomach some of the gross things that the SCProfessionals had to deal with, but fighting to get blood out of a carpet was just a nightmare no matter how you approached it. And Mr. Fernand's obviously expensive taste told Beau that in this house, he was more likely to destroy a rug by cleaning it than anything else.</p>\n<p>He'd been surprised to find wealth like this in Pierre. To be honest he'd been surprised to find anything in Pierre, South Dakota, at all. After his mom forged a path here with a boyfriend who left her a few weeks later and with his own dreams of living in L.A. just refusing to materialize, there hadn't been much choice but to pack up and head north.</p>\n<p>Now here he was, more steadily employed than most of his friends back in Philadelphia but with far less prospects. Proven, he realized, by the fact that he was currently wrestling a large bone out from behind a cabinet in the dining room. Like much of what he'd seen, how it got there was a mystery and from the size of Mr. Fernand, he could only assume his aggressive eating was a persistent threat to the surrounding environment. Somehow this bone (was that a femur?) was lodged between the leg of the heavy wooden cabinet and the wall. It <em>wasn't</em> coming loose.</p>\n<p>\"How the fuck\u2026\" Beau mumbled and he squatted next to the cabinet, gripping the bottom rim with his fingers barely an inch from the floor. Then with well-practiced patience and the fear of throwing his back out sitting on his shoulder, he lifted.</p>\n<p>It took a second of nothing happening before finally he felt that shift that told him he'd won. Just a few centimeters was all he needed. He slowly brought himself to his full height, edging upward bit-by-bit, till he heard the clatter of the bone coming loose. He aimed a few frantic kicks in the direction of the clatter and sent it spinning out from under the cabinet and under the table. He watched it ricochet for a bit, amused, then he slowly set the cabinet down again so he could go retrieve his find.</p>\n<p>The bone was quite large, which was probably why he thought it was a femur, but then he had to ask if elks had femurs? They probably did, but were they this big? How big was an elk? He inspected the bone more closely, seeing the meat had been cleanly stripped from it and it had been gnawed on. He froze.</p>\n<p>Why were these bite marks so blunt? These didn't look like they were made by dog's teeth. Unless\u2026</p>\n<p>\"Hello, Beau!\" Mr. Fernand's voice chimed, announcing his entry. He carried a silver tray, tiny in his massive hand, laden with two glasses and a jug of lemonade. \"I see you didn't have any lemonade! You should have helped yourself. I'm so sorry I took so long, but my little baby just went poopy all over and I had to clean it up.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, it's no problem!\" Beau said, turning around to find Mr. Fernand standing so close he could smell the sweat mixing with his too-sweet cologne.</p>\n<p>\"What do you have there?\" Mr. Fernand asked through his perpetually gritted teeth. His beady eyes inspected the bone and Beau in turn.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, yeah, I found this behind the cabinet.\"</p>\n<p>\"You moved the cabinet?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh! Yeah, I'm great at moving stuff.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm glad to hear that, but tell me, you seem confused.\" Mr. Fernand peered closer, almost vivisecting him with his gaze. \"Why's that?\"</p>\n<p>Beau looked from Mr. Fernand to the bone, to the tray of lemonade that looked really welcoming and back to Mr. Fernand and said, \"Well, I just think this isn't an appropriate chew toy for your dog. I don't know if that's rude of me, but I just don't.\"</p>\n<p>\"I-\" Mr. Fernand leaned back to look at Beau from his full height once more, clearly perplexed. \"Why do you say that?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, look,\" Beau pointed to the bite marks. \"Your dog's old, isn't it? It's going poopy on the carpet and it's teeth are super blunt. I think these kinds of chew toys are bad for its gums. It may need a softer chewie.\"</p>\n<p>Mr. Fernand stood silently watching him for a bit, clearly processing what he'd heard. Beau didn't like giving unsolicited advice, but he just didn't like the idea of a dog hurting itself by accident. Mr. Fernand probably didn't even know it was bad for the dog, which was the only reason Beau had said anything. It'd be very inappropriate for him to speak to customers like that normally, but this was for a dog and he wasn't going to apologize for it.</p>\n<p>\"It had never occurred to me,\" Mr. Fernand said meekly, his expression shifting suddenly. \"I'm so sorry. I'll make sure to get that on the list immediately. I'll go get fresh toys when you're done here today.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, you don't need to apologize. You probably didn't even know.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're right, but still, the thought that I've caused my beloved any harm is just too much right now,\" Mr. Fernand held out his hand (more a paw really) and looked suddenly misty-eyed. \"Hand it over. Let me dispose of the foul thing!\"</p>\n<p>Mr. Fernand was taking this very seriously, but if this dramatic Frenchman wanted to atone, who was Beau to stop him? He held the bone out and Fernand snatched it away and disappeared back into the house.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you for the lemonade!\" Beau called after him.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The lemonade really was very good and he kept a glass with him as he worked, making sure the old wood was properly polished and the room properly aired after the smell of barbecue sauce (there was definitely smokey-chipotle sauce at play, too) had pervaded the air so thickly Beau felt he could dip a buffalo wing in it. He still hadn't managed to find a way to get whatever was on the roof off and Mr. Fernand had disappeared so while a ladder was out of the question, he moved on.</p>\n<p>The kitchen was his final task and fortunately, the earlier clean-up had helped a lot. Mr. Fernand had also been very conscientious and not added any major mess to the kitchen at all. So with Secondhand Serenade screaming about falling for someone to keep him company, he began to mop the marble.</p>\n<p>Oddly, while being a cleaning service had never been where he saw himself, this was not unlike what he would have ended up doing at a studio in L.A. so, he liked to see something cosmic in that. Each stroke of the mop was pretty therapeutic too. In the garage, he'd worked in short, quick strokes, scrubbing the blood out of the concrete with frenetic vigour.</p>\n<p>Here, his strokes were long and firm, almost languidly heavy, drawing blood and worse off the tiles and making them sparkle more and more as he went. The dishes had already run in the dishwasher, so making this place shine was the last order of business for the day. As his reflection became more clear in the floor beneath him, Beau couldn't help but smile.</p>\n<p>It was during his return to Single Ladies that he nearly twisted an ankle as he did a double-take watching the mystery-whatever that had been stuck to the adjoining dining room's roof suddenly come loose and plopped down onto the floor.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, cool.\" He said and walked over, pulling his earphones out of his ears. Apparently, all he needed was patience, he thought as he bent down to pick up what he could now see looked like skin with long black hair connected to it. \"Weird.\"</p>\n<p>But another word didn't have a chance to cross his lips as the roof above him suddenly shuddered viciously. He stumbled backwards out of the dining room and leaned on the kitchen counter, staring wide-eyed at the roof, now basically rattling the chandelier loose with each pounding shake. Soon, a loud yell from upstairs snatched Beau's attention and without thinking he set off. Something wasn't right!</p>\n<p>He stormed up the stairs, following the sound of a struggle. The upstairs was uncannily dark, but the passage was clear, so Beau followed the noise swiftly. His feet carried him quickly across the soft carpets and he strained his ears to listen for more details before he arrived. Had someone snuck in while Beau hadn't been paying attention? Mr. Fernand was speaking, babbling in French it seemed, but he couldn't hear him clearly over the sound of crashing furniture and the cries of probably the largest dog in the world.</p>\n<p>Beau approached the room at the end of a long hall where the commotion was coming from. Once again, he found the door ajar and he inched closer as he heard the thrashing from inside, mingled with strings of guttural French. \"Mr. Fernand?\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't come in!\" Mr. Fernand shrieked and Beau froze as the door slammed shut. \"It's not safe!\"</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Fernand, what's that noise? Do you need help?\" Beau leaned closer, trying to hear what was happening. Mr. Fernand was alive, but none of this made sense. If it wasn't safe, why was he still in there then?</p>\n<p>\"No, no! Stay out there. My baby is having a fit. She's just struggling to take her medicine,\" Mr. Fernand's voice strained against the stress of holding back the noisily struggling dog and Beau debated going in. \"It'll be okay. This is normal. Everything is normal!\"</p>\n<p>Beau heard more thudding and then the sudden approached of footsteps. Another crash followed shortly and the door in front of Beau juddered as something was thrown and held against it. It rattled violently for a second and then a single, sudden and sickening crack echoed through the door and all was quiet once again.</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Fernand! Are you okay?\" Beau's voice was loud and clear, just like he'd been taught in drama club, but he never thought he'd be using it for this. \"What was that sound?\"</p>\n<p>\"Massage for my dog,\" Mr. Fernand said and Beau could hear the giant moving toward the door. It swung open and Mr. Fernand towered there with a smile on his reddened face, panting a bit. \"It always calms her down when I click her neck. I'm sorry if I scared you.\"</p>\n<p>Beau looked up at Mr. Fernand's smile and quickly smiled back. \"Nah, it's okay,\" he said with a shrug. \"I was just worried. If you're okay and your dog's okay then that's cool. I can just give you an update on how things are going. I'm almost done, actually.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, yes! Absolutely, please do!\" Mr. Fernand said, gesturing back down the hall so Beau could lead the way.</p>\n<p>\"Sure thing!\" said Beau, but his eyes trailed off for a second before focusing again. \"I'm sorry, I feel so rude. I never got your dog's name.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh!\" Mr. Fernand snickered. \"Tiffany.\"</p>\n<p>Beau processed that for a second then smiled once again. \"That's a real cool name for a dog.\"</p>\n<p>\"Isn't it just?\" Mr. Fernand laughed some more as he stepped into the hall, indicating it was time for them to head downstairs. \"And Beau, would you mind if I arrange short notice for you to come in tomorrow morning, as well?\"</p>\n<p>\"I mean, I don't think the job's gonna take that long.\"</p>\n<p>\"No, no,\" Mr. Fernand smiled his toothy smile. \"I've decided to host another impromptu soiree.\"</p>\n<p>Beau blinked for a second and then remembered that whales could take entire days to clean up and he said, \"Sure, thing! I'll call the boss myself!

Alright.\"//\n\n\n\n= //\"...\"//\n\n\n\n= //\"Hey, Beau, what's for dinner?\"//\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nBeau wasn't sure what the \"Colonial Revival\" Dee told him to look for was, but as he looked at the latest job location for Customer 082 -- Mr. Fernand -- from the bottom of the driveway, he supposed it had something to do with being rich. High, whitewashed walls lined with pillars and neat blue shutters for the windows smiled at him as he inched the clanking van emblazoned with the words SAFE CLEANUP PROFESSIONALS down the driveway in the early morning sun.\n\n\n\nApparently, Mr. Fernand was a gourmand who hosted parties around town that often left quite a mess -- a mess that only the Foundation was willing to clean up. His mentor, Dee, had told him all the new guys had to do it at least once. Beau didn't mind. If Mr. Fernand hung out in fancy houses like this, he'd clean with a smile on his face. Here, in the wealthy suburbs of Pierre, the stillness of //some// isolation blocked out the noise from the world outside. It was truly peaceful and as Beau approached the front door, he found himself smiling. \n\n\n\nAs Beau ascended the stairs to the door on the chilly morning, he noticed it stood slightly ajar. He froze, staring for a second, wondering why anyone would be so silly. It was freezing and all this cold air wasn't going to be good for a person. At least, that's what his gran had told him. Getting closer, he couldn't help but notice the red fingerprints smeared on the door. He peered at them closely, wondering what it was going to take to get that off.\n\n\n\nAfter a second of considering the problem in front of him, he realised he was being watched from deeper in the house. A looming shadow from the top of the stairs peered down at him and Beau took it as his cue.\n\n\n\n\"Hello?\" Beau said uncertainly. \"This is Beau from the cleaning agency. SCP - Cleanliness Guaranteed!\"\n\n\n\nThundering footsteps approached the door hurriedly and Beau's stomach knotted, waiting for him to be told he had the wrong house and that he was going to get melted by an old god if he didn't leave immediately. As the door swung open, though, Mr. Fernand beamed down at him from his towering full height. His wide, lopsided mouth approximated a smile, a smile Beau couldn't help but return. Happy clients were always a joy, especially if they were smiling before he even started.\n\n\n\n\"My good friend!\" Mr. Fernand spoke in reedy, heavily-accented English and stood back to let him into the entrance hall. It was a little cramped, but the light from the window above the door bathed the room in a welcoming warmth. The smudges on the floor were going to be a nightmare to deal with, but he was getting the idea it was the least of his worries.\u00a0\u00a0\"It is so good of you to come out on such short notice. Usually I schedule things more comfortably, but last night's affair was so short notice, I didn't have a chance to set anything up with the agency. Thank you so much for your time.\"\n\n\n\n\"Not at all!\" Beau chuckled. \"This is way better than the whale my colleagues have to go scrape up this morning. A dinner party, I can deal with.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's more the prep for the dinner party that needs to get cleaned up,\" Mr. Fernand explained, indicating for Beau to follow as he disappeared into the adjoining living room. \"We had venison and I was preparing the elk and let's just say it got messy. The garage and dining room are going to need some proper work. Don't mind the smudges. There was quite a sticky basting sauce.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's not a problem. It's what I'm here for. You'll just need to show me the area of biggest concern for you right now.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sure, sure!\" said Mr. Fernand. \"I'll be happy to.\"\n\n\n\n\"Also, may I say, nice cravat?\" Beau said, his eye catching another broad smear along a wall.\n\n\n\n\"Oh! You like it? It was a gift from the Prince of Venezuela! We met last week for his birthday and he just handed it to me. What was I to do, say no?\" Mr. Fernand tutted. \"Of course, not.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, that you're totally right. You can't look a gift like that in the mouth. The Prince would have been angry.\"\n\n\n\nMr. Fernand didn't stop nattering about the Prince as he led the way through the elegant home. Beau was there to work though, so as much as he was getting lost in the tales Fernand was telling, he made sure to keep scanning the space for marks. There were a lot of them. Fernand's guests, whoever they were, had thoroughly enjoyed their dinner, it seemed. \n\n\n\nA loud thud from upstairs stopped them in their tracks. Mr. Fernand's eyes shot towards the staircase, his ear cocked, listening closely. \n\n\n\n\"Is everything okay?\" Beau asked.\n\n\n\n\"Yes. The dog is just being naughty again.\" Fernand said, his expression relaxing before he slowly nodded and carried on leading the way, satisfied the dog had gone quiet.\n\n\n\n\"What breed are they?\" \n\n\n\n\"Chihuahua,\" said Fernand and signaled for Beau to follow. \"Come. I'll show you where the party starts.\" \n\n\n\nBeau dutifully followed, but he was pretty sure he was getting the idea of what waited for him in the garage from last night's debris scattered about. The kitchen was a mess of blood and viscera -- looked like lungs, to be specific -- marring the sink, stove and counter space. Fernand, to his credit, seemed at least a little embarrassed at the state of the place and Beau wondered if he'd need to call in Dee to help with this one. It was still early, he reminded himself; there would be enough time. \n\n\n\n\"So as part of my show for the guests, I start in here,\" Fernand said, leading the way into the wide garage down a path lined with flowerbeds waiting for spring. \"This is where I gut and clean the animal for the guests. Of course, I keep the killing of the animal for before. It becomes problematic to serve dinner once your guests are emotionally invested in the meal, so to speak.\"\n\n\n\n\"Whoa!\" said Beau as he stepped in to find yet more viscera and blood centered around a stainless steel hook hanging in the center of the room. Unlike the kitchen, there was no control to this mess. Somehow, Fernand had got bits of his pre-cooked dinner on the roof, on the walls and on the floor. \"This is so interactive!\"\n\n\n\n\"You understand!\" Fernand clapped his hands together, delighted. \"I honestly just like putting on a show for my guests and having them choose the parts they'll be eating draws them so much closer to the experience, don't you think?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, that sounds pretty immersive, alright!\" Beau smiled, turning to regard the garage. \"I'm going to need to get started, though. It wasn't just your guests that were immersed last night.\"\n\n\n\n\"Of course! Of course! Let me get out of your way! If you need anything, anything at all, I'm just upstairs.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thanks a lot! And it's just in here, the kitchen and dining room, right?\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh yes, the housekeeper comes on Monday, but there's just no way I was going to call her in for this,\" he said and a grin spread across his face. \"She doesn't quite have the stomach for my parties.\"\n\n\n\nA long silence hung between them as Fernand's eyes traced lines across Beau's face. But Beau quickly began to feel the weight of his backpack and dumped it on the ground and brightly said, \"Well, I better get to work!\"\n\n\n\n------\n\nIn the words of Mister Fritz Diedrich Williams, Administrator of the Safe Cleanup Professionals Foundation, \"An SCProfessional's best friend is soap, water and //elbow grease!// Get scrubbing.\"\n\n\n\nSo that's what Beau did. He took a quick sweep of the mess of the house and gathered what he could. Fortunately, Mr. Fernand had put most of the leftovers away already, and Beau had to admit, the crackling looked pretty good. Here and there, the streaks of a cloth made from a shirt that now sat crusted and dried on the edge of the sink told Beau that Mr. Fernand had probably tried to clean up himself before giving up. He couldn't help but chuckle. Some people just needed that extra bit of help, and from how hard Fernand was clenching his jaw, this was all probably pretty overwhelming for him. \n\n\n\n\"Eat shit, Dee,\" he said, dropping the last of some bones, marrow sucked clean, into the trash and heading for the oozing lungs in the sink. \"This is way better than whale clean-up.\"\n\n\n\nHe clapped his hands free of dust and sticky sinew over the trashcan and took a deep breath before heading back to the van. The pressure hose was his favourite part and the set-up would take a minute. Of course, part of that set-up meant disappearing behind the garage to smoke a joint. There was no way he was going to be away from management's eyes and //not// have some fun. Besides, the garage was an abattoir after Fernand's performance art and getting stoned would only help him appreciate it more.\n\n\n\nDee's weed harshed his throat more than he liked, but it was weed in South Dakota, so he really didn't have high expectations. He knew better than to have expectations at all. He'd learned the hard way.\n\n\n\nWith a smile on his face and //Paper Planes// blaring in his ears, Beau set to work. SCP didn't do much fancy in the way of chemicals, from what he could tell. It really was just elbow grease and soap, he was pretty sure. He did get to meet interesting people like Mr. Fernand and knowing that werewolves actually //did// exist was pretty cool. Then again, he'd kind of always known it, but it was like a war on the other side of the world -- out of sight, out of mind.\n\n\n\nThe rhythmic scrape of the broom's hard bristles slowly scrubbed away Fernand's theatrics from the night before as the sun climbed higher in the sky. Beau had worked up a firm sweat despite the winter cold and was taking a break round back with more of his joint when a shadow from the house caught his attention.\n\n\n\n\"Shit!\" He hissed, stubbing the roach dead on the bottom of his shoe, trying to exhale what he could. He was confident Fernand wouldn't smell anything as he clambered out from behind the garage. \"Mr. Fernand, I'm so sorry! I was just taking a look out back to see if that may need attention. You know we have wonderful gardening services, too?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'll keep that in mind for the spring!\" Fernand said cheerily, casting his eyes towards the gaping maw of the garage and nodding. \"You're making very good progress. Fritz sure knows how to hire.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thank you, but I just think the mess was pretty controlled, honestly.\" He wasn't a good liar, but what else was there to say? He didn't take compliments well. \"Just needs some elbow grease. I hope you don't mind, I moved the freezer. There was blood behind it that I wanted to get out.\"\n\n\n\n\"You moved the freezer?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, I'm pretty good at moving things.\"\n\n\n\n\"I see.\" Fernand's eyes moved between the freezer and Beau for a few seconds before he smiled widely again. \"That's wonderful news! You're very thorough and that is honestly so appreciated. Not enough people take pride in their work these days and it's that kind of dedication that will carry you far young man!\"\n\n\n\n\"You're too kind.\"\n\n\n\n\"Would you like some lemonade? All this work won't be good for you without a refreshment!\"\n\n\n\n\"That'd be --\" A crash came from the nearby second floor window followed immediately by a loud yelp. \n\n\n\n\"That darn dog!\" Fernand snarled and then he set off with urgent steps towards the house before chiming over his shoulder. \"I'll be right back with your lemonade!\"\n\n\n\n\"Thank you!\" \n\n\n\nBeau chuckled as he watched the behemoth of a man disappear into the house. He was busy putting his earphones back in, when suddenly a piercing shriek cut through the air from the house. Beau's head\u00a0\u00a0swiveled in the direction of the noise and he saw through the open window as Fernand stared down at a flailing mass of hair jittering from just below the window sill. Obviously his dog was quite excitable. Cold fury crossed Fernand's face and just as he looked like he was about to erupt, he saw Beau watching. \n\n\n\n\"Oh, Beau! I'm so sorry,\" he cried from through the window, stepping around the agitated animal. \"My dog seems to have gone potty on my rug. I'll have to handle this before I bring you that lemonade, but if you're really quite thirsty you can help yourself to some in the refrigerator.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sure thing, Mr. Fernand! Do you need help with that mess? It's kind of what I'm here for.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, no!\" Fernand said, hastily. \"You just listen to your music and keep busy there or you'll never get finished. It's just a small mess. I can handle this.\"\n\n\n\nWithout another word, Fernand stepped back and drew the curtains closed with a flourish, which, Beau thought as he put his earphones back in, wasn't going to help with the smell. Especially considering how big that chihuahua was.\n\n------\n\n\n\nThe dining room wasn't as bad as it could have been, Beau reckoned. If the prep areas were abattoirs, he had half expected the dining room to have food in places he didn't know were places. One thing he was worried about though was the piece of //something// that had somehow hit the roof and stayed there. He'd need to get that down, but that was a worry for later and so he turned his attention to the kitchen floors. With Single Ladies on repeat, he set to work. \n\n\n\nMr. Fernand never did come back with that lemonade, but Beau just laughed it off. He was probably having a fit over some dog shit on some too-expensive rug. Thank God the downstairs had wooden floors. He could stomach some of the gross things that the SCProfessionals had to deal with, but fighting to get blood out of a carpet was just a nightmare no matter how you approached it. And Mr. Fernand's obviously expensive taste told Beau that in this house, he was more likely to destroy a rug by cleaning it than anything else.\n\n\n\nHe'd been surprised to find wealth like this in Pierre. To be honest he'd been surprised to find anything in Pierre, South Dakota, at all. After his mom forged a path here with a boyfriend who left her a few weeks later and with his own dreams of living in L.A. just refusing to materialize, there hadn't been much choice but to pack up and head north.\n\n\n\nNow here he was, more steadily employed than most of his friends back in Philadelphia but with far less prospects. Proven, he realized, by the fact that he was currently wrestling a large bone out from behind a cabinet in the dining room. Like much of what he'd seen, how it got there was a mystery and from the size of Mr. Fernand, he could only assume his aggressive eating was a persistent threat to the surrounding environment. Somehow this bone (was that a femur?) was lodged between the leg of the heavy wooden cabinet and the wall. It //wasn't// coming loose.\n\n\n\n\"How the fuck...\" Beau mumbled and he squatted next to the cabinet, gripping the bottom rim with his fingers barely an inch from the floor. Then with well-practiced patience and the fear of throwing his back out sitting on his shoulder, he lifted. \n\n\n\nIt took a second of nothing happening before finally he felt that shift that told him he'd won. Just a few centimeters was all he needed. He slowly brought himself to his full height, edging upward bit-by-bit, till he heard the clatter of the bone coming loose. He aimed a few frantic kicks in the direction of the clatter and sent it spinning out from under the cabinet and under the table. He watched it ricochet for a bit, amused, then he slowly set the cabinet down again so he could go retrieve his find.\n\n\n\nThe bone was quite large, which was probably why he thought it was a femur, but then he had to ask if elks had femurs? They probably did, but were they this big? How big was an elk? He inspected the bone more closely, seeing the meat had been cleanly stripped from it and it had been gnawed on. He froze. \n\n\n\nWhy were these bite marks so blunt? These didn't look like they were made by dog's teeth. Unless... \n\n\n\n\"Hello, Beau!\" Mr. Fernand's voice chimed, announcing his entry. He carried a silver tray, tiny in his massive hand, laden with two glasses and a jug of lemonade. \"I see you didn't have any lemonade! You should have helped yourself. I'm so sorry I took so long, but my little baby just went poopy all over and I had to clean it up.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, it's no problem!\" Beau said, turning around to find Mr. Fernand standing so close he could smell the sweat mixing with his too-sweet cologne. \n\n\n\n\"What do you have there?\" Mr. Fernand asked through his perpetually gritted teeth. His beady eyes inspected the bone and Beau in turn.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, yeah, I found this behind the cabinet.\"\n\n\n\n\"You moved the cabinet?\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh! Yeah, I'm great at moving stuff.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm glad to hear that, but tell me, you seem confused.\" Mr. Fernand peered closer, almost vivisecting him with his gaze. \"Why's that?\"\n\n\n\nBeau looked from Mr. Fernand to the bone, to the tray of lemonade that looked really welcoming and back to Mr. Fernand and said, \"Well, I just think this isn't an appropriate chew toy for your dog. I don't know if that's rude of me, but I just don't.\"\n\n\n\n\"I-\" Mr. Fernand leaned back to look at Beau from his full height once more, clearly perplexed. \"Why do you say that?\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, look,\" Beau pointed to the bite marks. \"Your dog's old, isn't it? It's going poopy on the carpet and it's teeth are super blunt. I think these kinds of chew toys are bad for its gums. It may need a softer chewie.\"\n\n\n\nMr. Fernand stood silently watching him for a bit, clearly processing what he'd heard. Beau didn't like giving unsolicited advice, but he just didn't like the idea of a dog hurting itself by accident. Mr. Fernand probably didn't even know it was bad for the dog, which was the only reason Beau had said anything. It'd be very inappropriate for him to speak to customers like that normally, but this was for a dog and he wasn't going to apologize for it.\n\n\n\n\"It had never occurred to me,\" Mr. Fernand said meekly, his expression shifting suddenly. \"I'm so sorry. I'll make sure to get that on the list immediately. I'll go get fresh toys when you're done here today.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, you don't need to apologize. You probably didn't even know.\"\n\n\n\n\"You're right, but still, the thought that I've caused my beloved any harm is just too much right now,\" Mr. Fernand held out his hand (more a paw really) and looked suddenly misty-eyed. \"Hand it over. Let me dispose of the foul thing!\" \n\n\n\nMr. Fernand was taking this very seriously, but if this dramatic Frenchman wanted to atone, who was Beau to stop him? He held the bone out and Fernand snatched it away and disappeared back into the house. \n\n\n\n\"Thank you for the lemonade!\" Beau called after him.\n\n------\n\n\n\nThe lemonade really was very good and he kept a glass with him as he worked, making sure the old wood was properly polished and the room properly aired after the smell of barbecue sauce (there was definitely smokey-chipotle sauce at play, too) had pervaded the air so thickly Beau felt he could dip a buffalo wing in it. He still hadn't managed to find a way to get whatever was on the roof off and Mr. Fernand had disappeared so while a ladder was out of the question, he moved on.\n\n\n\nThe kitchen was his final task and fortunately, the earlier clean-up had helped a lot. Mr. Fernand had also been very conscientious and not added any major mess to the kitchen at all. So with Secondhand Serenade screaming about falling for someone to keep him company, he began to mop the marble.\n\n\n\nOddly, while being a cleaning service had never been where he saw himself, this was not unlike what he would have ended up doing at a studio in L.A. so, he liked to see something cosmic in that. Each stroke of the mop was pretty therapeutic too. In the garage, he'd worked in short, quick strokes, scrubbing the blood out of the concrete with frenetic vigour. \n\n\n\nHere, his strokes were long and firm, almost languidly heavy, drawing blood and worse off the tiles and making them sparkle more and more as he went. The dishes had already run in the dishwasher, so making this place shine was the last order of business for the day. As his reflection became more clear in the floor beneath him, Beau couldn't help but smile.\n\n\n\nIt was during his return to Single Ladies that he nearly twisted an ankle as he did a double-take watching the mystery-whatever that had been stuck to the adjoining dining room's roof suddenly come loose and plopped down onto the floor. \n\n\n\n\"Oh, cool.\" He said and walked over, pulling his earphones out of his ears. Apparently, all he needed was patience, he thought as he bent down to pick up what he could now see looked like skin with long black hair connected to it. \"Weird.\"\n\n\n\nBut another word didn't have a chance to cross his lips as the roof above him suddenly shuddered viciously. He stumbled backwards out of the dining room and leaned on the kitchen counter, staring wide-eyed at the roof, now basically rattling the chandelier loose with each pounding shake. Soon, a loud yell from upstairs snatched Beau's attention and without thinking he set off. Something wasn't right!\n\n\n\nHe stormed up the stairs, following the sound of a struggle. The upstairs was uncannily dark, but the passage was clear, so Beau followed the noise swiftly. His feet carried him quickly across the soft carpets and he strained his ears to listen for more details before he arrived. Had someone snuck in while Beau hadn't been paying attention? Mr. Fernand was speaking, babbling in French it seemed, but he couldn't hear him clearly over the sound of crashing furniture and the cries of probably the largest dog in the world.\n\n\n\nBeau approached the room at the end of a long hall where the commotion was coming from. Once again, he found the door ajar and he inched closer as he heard the thrashing from inside, mingled with strings of guttural French. \"Mr. Fernand?\"\n\n\n\n\"Don't come in!\" Mr. Fernand shrieked and Beau froze as the door slammed shut. \"It's not safe!\"\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Fernand, what's that noise? Do you need help?\" Beau leaned closer, trying to hear what was happening. Mr. Fernand was alive, but none of this made sense. If it wasn't safe, why was he still in there then?\n\n\n\n\"No, no! Stay out there. My baby is having a fit. She's just struggling to take her medicine,\" Mr. Fernand's voice strained against the stress of holding back the noisily struggling dog and Beau debated going in. \"It'll be okay. This is normal. Everything is normal!\"\n\n\n\nBeau heard more thudding and then the sudden approached of footsteps. Another crash followed shortly and the door in front of Beau juddered as something was thrown and held against it. It rattled violently for a second and then a single, sudden and sickening crack echoed through the door and all was quiet once again.\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Fernand! Are you okay?\" Beau's voice was loud and clear, just like he'd been taught in drama club, but he never thought he'd be using it for this. \"What was that sound?\"\n\n\n\n\"Massage for my dog,\" Mr. Fernand said and Beau could hear the giant moving toward the door. It swung open and Mr. Fernand towered there with a smile on his reddened face, panting a bit. \"It always calms her down when I click her neck. I'm sorry if I scared you.\"\n\n\n\nBeau looked up at Mr. Fernand's smile and quickly smiled back. \"Nah, it's okay,\" he said with a shrug. \"I was just worried. If you're okay and your dog's okay then that's cool. I can just give you an update on how things are going. I'm almost done, actually.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, yes! Absolutely, please do!\" Mr. Fernand said, gesturing back down the hall so Beau could lead the way.\n\n\n\n\"Sure thing!\" said Beau, but his eyes trailed off for a second before focusing again. \"I'm sorry, I feel so rude. I never got your dog's name.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh!\" Mr. Fernand snickered. \"Tiffany.\"\n\n\n\nBeau processed that for a second then smiled once again. \"That's a real cool name for a dog.\"\n\n\n\n\"Isn't it just?\" Mr. Fernand laughed some more as he stepped into the hall, indicating it was time for them to head downstairs. \"And Beau, would you mind if I arrange short notice for you to come in tomorrow morning, as well?\"\n\n\n\n\"I mean, I don't think the job's gonna take that long.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, no,\" Mr. Fernand smiled his toothy smile. \"I've decided to host another impromptu soiree.\"\n\n\n\nBeau blinked for a second and then remembered that whales could take entire days to clean up and he said, \"Sure, thing! I'll call the boss myself! Now, you'll see I've actually made some good progress and I've got some products to recommend to keep your silver looking right.\"\n\n\n\n\"You can tell me all about it over sandwiches. I have some lovely cold-cuts we can have!\"\n\n\n\n\"That's very kind, but I'm actually watching what I eat,\" Beau said, looking over his shoulder. \"I'm trying to get //ripped// so I only eat at certain times.\"\n\n\n\nMr. Fernand sighed and smiled gently back at him, \"Your loss, but I really should have you for dinner sometime.\"\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n= //\"Caleb, don't be mad --\"//\n\n\n\n= //\"Beau, you said you were gonna bring pizza.

He looked around for the shitty BIC lighter he had bought from the dispensary earlier, finding it behind his keyboard. Moments later, the blunt was lit and he was taking a deep drag from it.

He almost dropped the blunt. Though he doubted it would incinerate his apartment, there was always that danger. Or at least he thought so, being the paranoid <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">fucker</span> he was. In truth, the flame from the blunt was so dull, it was likely to merely singe the carpet beneath him at worst, but again, Jude was as pathetic as he was paranoid. And yet there he was, worried about the flames of hell.</p>\n<p>He exhaled, the smoke leaving his body in one fell swoop. Smoking had always helped him feel more at ease, but as of late, it was turning into something to fill time rather than a tool to relax. As if he deserved to relax. Surely someone as fucked up and evil as him didn't deserve anything more than suffering.</p>\n<p>After all, he had committed murder. The ultimate sin. Paired with his aforementioned sins, he truly felt wicked. He took another drag of his blunt, this time a smaller one. He didn't immediately break out into hacking coughs, so that was a bonus.

He didn't deserve their friendship, much less their admiration. He was just a thirty-something year-old fuck up who spent his entire life stoned to cope with how much of a failure he was.

The mode through which this instance was produced is unknown as the entity was currently not being observed, and was only noticed during routine inspection for containment purposes hours later. The new SCP-1213-1 instance was removed from the containment vessel at once and placed in the care of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for study.</p>\n<p>As is typical for Foundation sites during times of increased holiday energy, it is believed that this event is an example of immaculate conception, as SCP-1213 has not had access to other members of its original dimension in several years. However, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has suggested that this event may be completely natural, pointing out the lack of consensus on SCP-1213's reproductive biology. Further work is required before a full determination is made. However, the following addition to SCP-1213\u2019s file is requested in the meantime:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Description of SCP-1213-1:</strong> The recently observed SCP-1213-1 instance is a wooden and rubber catapult of similar design to the larger SCP-1213, although much smaller. Of note, the design of the SCP-1213 instance uses rubber bands as a launching mechanism in place of the steel fittings on SCP-1213, taking an appropriate form for its small size. As a result, the SCP-1213-1 instance has been placed into the care of Sector-25 researchers in order to conduct a longitudinal growth study of the entity to determine more about the biology of the SCP-1213 organism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"footer-box\">\n<div class=\"bottom-left-box\">\n<div class=\"name-box\">Dr. Donatello \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</div>\n<div class=\"title-box\">Foundation Researcher (Sector-25)</div>\n<div class=\"sign-off-box\">Secure, Contain, Protect</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"attachment-box\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">*Open\u00a0email\u00a0attachment*</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Close</a></div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"dyna-email-container\">\n<div class=\"dyna-email\">\n<div class=\"header-box\">\n<div class=\"top-left-box cc-rchan7@scp.int\">\n<div class=\"from-box\">From:</div>\n<div class=\"to-box\">To:</div>\n<div class=\"cc-box cc-rchan7@scp.int\">CC:</div>\n<div class=\"subject-box\">Subject:</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"top-middle-box cc-rchan7@scp.int\">\n<div class=\"from-name-box\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">sector25_director@scp.int</span></div>\n<div class=\"to-name-box\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">dtjredacted@scp.int</span></div>\n<div class=\"cc-text-box cc-rchan7@scp.int\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">rchan7@scp.int</span></div>\n<div class=\"subject-text-box\">Re: Request of Addenda to be added to the SCP-1213 File</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"content-box\">\n<hr/>\n<p>Sounds good.

The mode through which this instance was produced is unknown as the entity was currently not being observed, and was only noticed during routine inspection for containment purposes hours later. The new SCP-1213-1 instance was removed from the containment vessel at once and placed in the care of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for study. \n\n\n\nAs is typical for Foundation sites during times of increased holiday energy, it is believed that this event is an example of immaculate conception, as SCP-1213 has not had access to other members of its original dimension in several years. However, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has suggested that this event may be completely natural, pointing out the lack of consensus on SCP-1213's reproductive biology. Further work is required before a full determination is made. However, the following addition to SCP-1213\u2019s file is requested in the meantime:\n\n\n\n> **Description of SCP-1213-1:** The recently observed SCP-1213-1 instance is a wooden and rubber catapult of similar design to the larger SCP-1213, although much smaller. Of note, the design of the SCP-1213 instance uses rubber bands as a launching mechanism in place of the steel fittings on SCP-1213, taking an appropriate form for its small size. As a result, the SCP-1213-1 instance has been placed into the care of Sector-25 researchers in order to conduct a longitudinal growth study of the entity to determine more about the biology of the SCP-1213 organism.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:dynamic-emails\">:scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails</a> attachment-end=--\n\n|name= Dr. Donatello \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n|title= Foundation Researcher (Sector-25)\n\n|signoff= Secure, Contain, Protect\n\n|signoff-icon= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:dynamic-emails/Default_Profile_Icon.png\n\n|attachment= http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/launched-into-parenthood/SCP-1213-1.jpeg\n\n]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:dynamic-emails\">:scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails</a> start=--\n\n|from= sector25_director@scp.int\n\n|to= dtjredacted@scp.int\n\n|cc= rchan7@scp.int\n\n|subject= Re: Request of Addenda to be added to the SCP-1213 File\n\n\n\n]]\n\nSounds good.

Between work, work and\u2026 <em>work</em>, he didn\u2019t have much time left in the week. How much of that was true and how much of it was a bad excuse in order to nor confront reality, he didn\u2019t even know, but it didn\u2019t really matter, because ever since he came back from Afghanistan, every year on the exact same day, Ibarra took the time to visit his friends.</p>\n<img alt=\"lazos1.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/lazos/lazos1.jpg\"/>\n<p>The agent stared at the piece of stone in front of him with an expression that was difficult to read. This was the last one he was going to visit this morning. The one he saved for last every year. He kneeled in front of it, noticing a bouquet of flowers he hadn\u2019t left. He faintly smiled at that.</p>\n<p>\"I see they are still visiting you, huh?\" He talked to the tomb. He paused, the subtle whistle of the light morning breeze being the only sound in the place. It was overwhelming.</p>\n<p>\"Your little sister must be all grown\u2026 How old is she turning this year? Seventeen? Eighteen? Mich told me she was thinking of studying photography.\" His voice began to fade alongside his smile.</p>\n<p>\"You\u2019d be\u2026 proud of her.\" The expression of the agent turned hollow and distant. He observed the tombstone in silence, clenching his teeth and frowning.</p>\n<p>Every year was the same. He avoided the topic, he tried to face it on November 11th, he talked to some pieces of stone, and he left more hollow than he arrived. It infuriated him. With a growl and a scowl, the man balled his fist with force and hit the grass, looking away from the tombstone. He was mad. At the circumstances, at the world, at God, even. But, above all, at himself. Because of him, the mothers of his friends were left without sons. Because of him, his friend wouldn\u2019t see his sister grow. Because of him, there were less good men in the world. Simple, <em>he didn\u2019t do enough.</em></p>\n<p>Fragments of the incident were repeated in his mind over and over again like a movie, always thinking how he could have done things differently. He changed what happened in his memory, took a different step, took a different path. But even in every scenario he made up, he couldn\u2019t escape the blood, nor the screams.</p>\n<p>His head started to feel heavy and unstable, leaving him dizzy.</p>\n<p>Ibarra closed his eyes, trying to focus. It didn\u2019t matter. He didn\u2019t do things differently, and that was it. Now he had to deal with the consequences, even if he didn\u2019t know how to.</p>\n<p>His hands and lips trembled, his breathing started to accelerate.</p>\n<p>When he returned from Afghanistan and got offered a job at the Foundation he didn\u2019t think twice, he needed some kind of redemption for his acts, and the job description fit the bill. But above all, he needed to <em>get away.</em> His position as an agent and emergency doctor forced him to move constantly. He would never have permanent housing, and he never had a fixed team. His work was getting showing up, helping, and then disengaging completely, then repeat the next week. And that worked for him. No time to form bonds meant he didn\u2019t have to add names to the list of visitors. He would never again be responsible for\u2026</p>\n<p>Ibarra started to feel every beat of his heart thump in his ears. He felt his throat closing, at the same time that his erratic and irregular heartbeats caused him a strong and sudden sensation of nausea.</p>\n<p>The agent raised his head slightly, reading the epitaph on the tombstone.</p>\n<p><em>The risk of losing whom you love is a small price to pay to have the opportunity to help them.</em></p>\n<p>The knot in his throat and chest tightened, and he felt like the world was about to crush him with invisible walls.</p>\n<p>\u201cFigured I\u2019d find you here.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The agent standing in front of the tomb turned his face around suddenly, the unexpected voice snapped him out of his thoughts and his mental turmoil. Swallowing his emotions, he placed his narrow sunglasses to hide the storm that was about to unfold. The owner of the voice was a tattooed man with long hair tied in a messy ponytail, a bit taller than Ibarra and with an Argentinian accent.</p>\n<p>Ibarra offered a light smile as a greeting.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Steffano.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steffano approached ibarra with a calm gesture, stopping at his side and in front of the tombstone. An elegant, grey formal vest overlayed with a black shirt matched a black pair of trousers, accompanied vy a pair of shoes that oscillated between a sporty and formal look. The agent's sleeves were rolled up, leaving a contrast between the formal and the aggressiveness that his tattoos implicitly radiated.</p>\n<p>In between his hands he brought a pair of folders, light in color, coated in plastic.</p>\n<p>\"Am I interrupting?\" Steffano asked with caution \"Finding you outside working hours was more difficult than I expected.\u201d</p>\n<p>The dark-skinned man sighed, observing with certain regret the tombstone in front of him, trying to clear the thoughts that made noise inside of his head. Eventually, he shook his head and stood up</p>\n<p>\"Nah, I was just finishing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steffano stood still in silence for a second alongside Ibarra. He never knew the soldier in the tombstone, but he knew they were someone important to his friend, so the least he could do was show some empathy and respect. He looked Ibarra out of the corner of his eye, noticing the clear tension in his hands and shoulders, speaking:</p>\n<p>\"You can\u2019t keep blaming yourself for this kind of stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ibarra smiled slightly, his gaze fixed on the tombstone.</p>\n<p>\"I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you keep doing so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ibarra took a moment to reply.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>Because I could\u2019ve done more. Because I should\u2019ve done more. Because I couldn\u2019t help them. Because I had to help them. Because they had a family. Because they didn\u2019t deserve to die. Because they should\u2019ve been saved. Because I should\u2019ve died with them.</em></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steffano pursed his lips lightly and nodded in an understanding gesture to his friend, giving him a firm pat on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, I get you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ibarra directed his gaze towards his teammate, feeling for just a brief second how the walls that tightened against him eased a bit. He knew that he understood, and that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t ask more at the moment.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Pero bueno,</em> are you visiting anyone, Steffano?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steffano let out a slight chuckle, shaking his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, mine aren\u2019t here. I was looking for you, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ibarra arched a brow, intrigued. He pointed to the folders that Steffano carried with a nod.</p>\n<p>\"Does it have anything to do with the folders you have there? Don\u2019t tell me you came here to give me paperwork.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steffano smirked, extending the folder towards Ibarra so he would take it.</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ibarra adjusted his glasses and took the folders, opening them. They contained a multitude of documents: budget estimates, agent's profiles, authorization letters, among other files. The documentation looked a lot like what's needed to authorize a new unit. The dark-skinned man looked at his friend over his glasses, waiting for him to tell him more while he reviewed in detail the information.</p>\n<p>\"I\u2019m building a team. I want my <em>own</em> squadron to play by my <em>own</em> rules, I feel that part of being stuck on the other side of the veil means cutting off your legs, if that makes any sense. I\u2019ve decided that if I\u2019m going to work for these people and their purposes, might as well do it in the way I deem correct. We are going to trip over and over again as we manage to reach something similar to stability, but until then I want my people near me. People I believe are worth having around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ibarra looked at his friend with certain doubt.</p>\n<p>\"You don\u2019t sound too sure of all of this. You usually are more painstaking, Steffano. This is the first time since we\u2019ve met that you try to make something in a hasty manner, I don\u2019t really know how to react.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Maybe, the only thing I can admit is that you\u2019re right, it\u2019s something new. Neither you, nor me are used to work other way that isn\u2019t a fucking chain of command formed by a pretentious general that has been in power behind a desk for 40 years, without getting a single damned scratch. And you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ibarra laughed with certain bitterness towards Steffano\u2019s comment, nodding. \"I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d His expression changed when his gaze stopped for a second in the profile of an agent that caught his attention.</p>\n<p>\"This boy\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\"Is this the one you\u2019ve been training personally?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steffano smirked when he saw who Ibarra was pointing at.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. V\u00edctor Penz,\u201d Steffano sighed. \"The kid is quite the case, but he has potential. <em>A lot</em> of potential.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"It\u2019s\u2026 Just a kid.\u201d There was a certain worry in the agent\u2019s tone. \u201cThere must be something in him for you to even consider having him around. He looks like a rookie, a problematic brat without any valid records.\u201d Ibarra searched between V\u00edctor\u2019s file over and over again, as if he was trying to gather some secret information in between the papers.</p>\n<p>\"He has it. Trust me. In fact, I was thinking of assigning him to an operation soon. I\u2019m not sure what kind of operation, but I\u2019d like for him to grow used to the kind of shit one can see in this weird world. The creatures and all that shit. And when that happens, you\u2019ll be there to see it, sooner or later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"My God, Steffano,\u201d The agent was conflicted by the idea. \u201cI don't know if it's a very good idea or if age and field work are driving you crazy, and it seems that you want to drive the kid crazy on the way too by throwing him head-first into these things. You not working for national intelligence agencies anymore doesn\u2019t mean you can throw away all cover and risk your personal reputation for a crazy midnight idea. I mean\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>The tattooed man interrupted him.</p>\n<p>\"Do you trust me?\u201d Steffano looked directly into Ibarra\u2019s eyes, trying to look further from his gaze.</p>\n<p>Ibarra blinked a few times, bewildered because of the question.</p>\n<p>\"What?\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Do you trust me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\"I\u2026\u201d Ibarra meditated for a few seconds. \u201cYeah, of course I trust you, dude. You\u2019re only old and crazy, but I\u2019ll be there when you get shot by a few dudes with no arms nor face.\u201d Ibarra began laughing resignedly.</p>\n<p>\"Fantastic. That\u2019s all I needed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steffano gave Ibarra a moment for him to finish looking at the documentation and processing the information.</p>\n<p>\"Your support in this would mean a lot, old man. I need people who are committed, capable, and whom I can trust. You are all three of those.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Ibarra sighed deeply. It wasn\u2019t a bad idea. A unit like this could be of great help for the Foundation. Most importantly, it could be of great help for <em>people</em>. A large number of losses, both civilian and from personnel in operations were due to a lack of rapid response in emergency situations. A large number of losses were due to <em>a lack of support.</em></p>\n<p>But joining a unit like that would signify stability. He would no longer be sent only to isolated jobs where his role was to appear and then bid farewell. He would go back to having some type of squadron, Ibarra would have to coexist with the same people constantly. He would have to <em>take care</em> of the same people constantly. Inevitably, he would form <em>bonds</em> with those people, because he was like that, he couldn\u2019t disconnect. And given the nature of the work, those people would be at risk of dying <em>constantly.</em></p>\n<p>The agent took his eyes off the documentation that was in his hands, redirecting his sight towards the tombstone that was forgotten in the conversation until this moment. He looked at it for a few seconds, ones that felt like minutes to him. He read the name. <em>Douglas Daniels.</em></p>\n<p><em>The risk of losing whom you love is a small price to pay to have the opportunity to help them.</em></p>\n<p>Ibarra spoke in a serious tone, without taking his eyes off the phrase.</p>\n<p>\"Did you come just for work? It's not something you usually do, it's not your kind of deal.\"</p>\n<p>\"No. I came because I knew that if I found you here, you\u2019d need a friend to keep you company.\u201d Steffano crossed his arms slowly, not expecting a fixed answer.</p>\n<p>After a couple of seconds, Ibarra sighed, decided, and looked back at Steffano.</p>\n<p>With a smile on his face, and his sunglasses now hiding his watery eyes, he offered his hand in a handshake.</p>\n<p>\"Count me in.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"earthworm earthworm--old-syntax-first-true earthworm--old-syntax-last-false earthworm--old-syntax-hub-yes {$class}\">\n<div class=\"first earthworm__previous\" data-title=\"/\">\n\n<p><a href=\"/\">/</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"hub earthworm__hub\" data-title=\"Special Hazards Response Protocol\">\n<p><a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/hub-shrp\">Special Hazards Response Protocol</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"last earthworm__next\" data-title=\"Distractions\">\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/distracciones\">Distractions</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><br/></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/lazos\">Bonds</a>\" by XenOGax, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Between work, work and\u2026 //work//, he didn\u2019t have much time left in the week. How much of that was true and how much of it was a bad excuse in order to nor confront reality, he didn\u2019t even know, but it didn\u2019t really matter, because ever since he came back from Afghanistan, every year on the exact same day, Ibarra took the time to visit his friends.\n\n\n\n[[image lazos1.jpg]]\n\n\n\nThe agent stared at the piece of stone in front of him with an expression that was difficult to read. This was the last one he was going to visit this morning. The one he saved for last every year. He kneeled in front of it, noticing a bouquet of flowers he hadn\u2019t left. He faintly smiled at that.\n\n\n\n\"I see they are still visiting you, huh?\" He talked to the tomb. He paused, the subtle whistle of the light morning breeze being the only sound in the place. It was overwhelming.\n\n\n\n\"Your little sister must be all grown\u2026 How old is she turning this year? Seventeen? Eighteen? Mich told me she was thinking of studying photography.\" His voice began to fade alongside his smile.\n\n\n\n\"You\u2019d be\u2026 proud of her.\" The expression of the agent turned hollow and distant. He observed the tombstone in silence, clenching his teeth and frowning.\n\n\n\nEvery year was the same. He avoided the topic, he tried to face it on November 11th, he talked to some pieces of stone, and he left more hollow than he arrived. It infuriated him. With a growl and a scowl, the man balled his fist with force and hit the grass, looking away from the tombstone. He was mad. At the circumstances, at the world, at God, even. But, above all, at himself. Because of him, the mothers of his friends were left without sons. Because of him, his friend wouldn\u2019t see his sister grow. Because of him, there were less good men in the world. Simple, //he didn\u2019t do enough.//\n\n\n\nFragments of the incident were repeated in his mind over and over again like a movie, always thinking how he could have done things differently. He changed what happened in his memory, took a different step, took a different path. But even in every scenario he made up, he couldn\u2019t escape the blood, nor the screams.\n\n\n\nHis head started to feel heavy and unstable, leaving him dizzy.\n\n\n\nIbarra closed his eyes, trying to focus. It didn\u2019t matter. He didn\u2019t do things differently, and that was it. Now he had to deal with the consequences, even if he didn\u2019t know how to.\n\n\n\nHis hands and lips trembled, his breathing started to accelerate.\n\n\n\nWhen he returned from Afghanistan and got offered a job at the Foundation he didn\u2019t think twice, he needed some kind of redemption for his acts, and the job description fit the bill. But above all, he needed to //get away.// His position as an agent and emergency doctor forced him to move constantly. He would never have permanent housing, and he never had a fixed team. His work was getting showing up, helping, and then disengaging completely, then repeat the next week. And that worked for him. No time to form bonds meant he didn\u2019t have to add names to the list of visitors. He would never again be responsible for\u2026\n\n\n\nIbarra started to feel every beat of his heart thump in his ears. He felt his throat closing, at the same time that his erratic and irregular heartbeats caused him a strong and sudden sensation of nausea.\n\n\n\nThe agent raised his head slightly, reading the epitaph on the tombstone.\n\n\n\n//The risk of losing whom you love is a small price to pay to have the opportunity to help them.//\n\n\n\nThe knot in his throat and chest tightened, and he felt like the world was about to crush him with invisible walls.\n\n\n\n\u201cFigured I\u2019d find you here.\u201d\n\n\n\n[[=image lazos2.jpg]]\n\n\n\nThe agent standing in front of the tomb turned his face around suddenly, the unexpected voice snapped him out of his thoughts and his mental turmoil.

Because I should\u2019ve done more. Because I couldn\u2019t help them. Because I had to help them. Because they had a family. Because they didn\u2019t deserve to die.

Uncertain translation and meaning, word seems to be compounded unusually from \u201clife\u201d, \u201csea\u201d and \u201cwater\u201d in the original text. Possible precursor to modern portmanteaus as seen in English and other Germanic descended languages.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-3\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-3')\">3</a>. Oral traditions throughout Finnfolk history have superstitiously assigned reproductive importance to only a single arm of most starfish species, even though, in actuality, they reproduce with all of them. It is currently unknown how deeply this belief persists in their modern, scientifically rigorous societies.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-4\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-4')\">4</a>. Five pearls as a cultural symbol seems to be present in most time periods of Finnfolk civilization. Modern iconography posits their significance similar to the romantic connotation of diamond rings in many areas of different human cultures, but it is uncertain if that same meaning is carried within this poem.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-5\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-5')\">5</a>. Fivefold repetition here and in other tercets of this poem suggest intentional anaphora instead of an accidental clustering of words, marking this poetic device as the earliest developed by pre-Mitheric Finnfolk, at least according to records known by the Foundation.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-6\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-6')\">6</a>. Most likely a precursor to the modern Finnfolk phrase \u201cof rocks, like starfish\u201d, roughly translating in meaning to \u201cthese two objects are closely related to each other in some manner, usually by virtue of physical characteristics\u201d, similar to the English idiom \u201clike father, like son\u201d. It is currently unknown why this connotation developed; the most likely explanation is the hard, calcified remains of dead starfish being likened to stones.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-7\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-7')\">7</a>. Uncertain translation. Literal translation is \u201clife carvings\u201d\u2014\u201ccarvings\u201d was translated to \u201cnames\u201d due to context clues and greater poetic impact.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-8\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-8')\">8</a>. Rhyming does not occur in the original translation; Finnfolk poetry did not express this trait until several decades after the First Sealing War\u2019s end.</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-9\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-9')\">9</a>.

It is theorized to have been created before the First Sealing War[[footnote]]Taking place from 3100 BCE to 3000 BCE.[[/footnote]], with thaumic-dating placing its origins at around roughly 6100-5900 BCE. Most likely to be part of a poem, it is one of the oldest examples of Finnfolk language and culture before its shaping by Mitheric influences into the forms we know today. \n\n\n\nIf you are reading this and not familiar with typical lens of historical poetic analysis, it is advised to first contact Dr. Molly Hussie at Site-212A to check on the date of available workshops, then to read this poem once without footnotes, and again with them for the best experience.\n\n\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[div class=\"scenesetter\"]]\n\n[[span style=\"color: blue; font-family: Grenze Gotisch ; font-size: 1.25rem\"]]Count their arms: I shall give blessings for each\n\n\n\nOne stroke of my scales\n\n\n\nTwo liftings out of the life-water [[footnote]]Uncertain translation and meaning, word seems to be compounded unusually from \u201clife\u201d, \u201csea\u201d and \u201cwater\u201d in the original text.

It is currently unknown how deeply this belief persists in their modern, scientifically rigorous societies.[[/footnote]] rest\n\n\n\nAnd five pearls[[footnote]]Five pearls as a cultural symbol seems to be present in most time periods of Finnfolk civilization.

href=\"http://www.scpwiki.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43\">Site-43</a>: Lambton County, Ontario, Canada</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>Dr. Nhung Ngo sat at her desk, eyeing her schedule. Though it mostly consisted of the usual suspects, today would be the first time she was going to meet a new patient, one that was causing her usually calm demeanor to falter. She had met anomalies, she had met immortal beings, she had met children.</p>\n<p>But she had never met a <a href=\"/scp-8726\">permanently 6-year-old immortal</a>.</p>\n<p>James Everwood-Reynders, the adopted son of Site-43's new resident GoI Specialist and Acroamatic Abatement Chair, was due for his bi-yearly checkup; his first since coming to Site-43 from Site-55 down in Boston. Ngo knew that he had been born from the D-Class Parenthood Program, one of probably the most messed up things she had ever heard the Foundation was actively doing. And that included whatever the hell was going on in 17.</p>\n<p>She had read his file; Ngo knew that Dr. Everwood had fought to ensure he was treated like a peer after he was brought onto their team to assist in Dr. Wondertainment research, but had somehow wound up adopting him somewhere along the way. Site-55 was a weird place, but as weird as it was, Site-43 was even weirder still. Due to it's weirdness and resident immortal/James' adopted mother Dr. Ilse Reynders, this seemed like a good place to raise him. <em>Better than 17</em>, Ngo thought.</p>\n<p>A knock at the door.</p>\n<p>\"Come in,\" she said, putting on a warm smile.</p>\n<p>The door opened to reveal a person wearing a sweater with only one sleeve full and a little boy holding a Nintendo Switch, wearing a poofy jacket and knitted cap.</p>\n<p>\"Hello, Dr. Ngo. I hope you don't mind we're early.\" Jay Everwood smiled at Ngo, their hand on the boy's left shoulder. \"James, <em>como se dice?</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"Hi.\" James didn't look up from his Switch.</p>\n<p>\"No worries at all, Jay. How is Dr. Reynders?\" She got up from her desk, picking up a clipboard.</p>\n<p>\"Ilse is well. She's still obsessed with Gushers; to the point where James here can barely sneak one packet whenever we buy a box. But high fructose corn syrup aside, they are doing okay.\" Everwood laughed.</p>\n<p>\"That's great to hear. Maybe not the high fructose corn syrup bit, but I'm glad she's enjoying life. Come in, come in.\"</p>\n<p>Everwood and James entered the office, and his adoptive parent held out their hand to him, signaling to hand over the toy. James grumbled but obliged, putting his Switch into sleep mode and letting them take it.</p>\n<p>\"You'll get it back when you're done with Dr. Ngo, okay?\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay\u2026\" He pouted.</p>\n<p>\"Come on, sit on the couch and listen to what she has to say, and make sure to answer her questions. Be good. Love you.\" Everwood leaned down and kissed the top of James' head. The boy hopped up onto Ngo's couch while the psychologist sat across from him in a comfy arm chair.</p>\n<p>\"See you in an hour, Jay.\" Ngo grinned as they waved a goodbye to her, shutting the door behind them.</p>\n<p>The boy seemed standoffish. He was not making eye contact, instead opting to stare at his shoes. She cleared her throat and reached behind her ear for a pen to start taking notes.</p>\n<p>\"Hello, James. My name is Dr. Ngo.\"</p>\n<p>No response came.</p>\n<p>\"Your parent tells me you're a very sweet kid. What do you think?\"</p>\n<p>No response once more.</p>\n<p>\"Are you shy?\"</p>\n<p>He nodded, but did not look up.</p>\n<p>\"Well, that's okay. I am a stranger, after all, but I'm a friend of your parents and I'm here to help you assimilate into Site-43.\"</p>\n<p>\"What does ass\u2026 assimini\u2026 assimilate mean?\" James looked up but appeared to be staring through her.</p>\n<p>\"It means to make yourself at home.\" Ngo smiled reassuringly.</p>\n<p>\"My old home was Site-55. I used to play with Rex, May, and Chidi. They were my parent's em\u2026employees.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wow, you're using big words, James. I'm sure both your parents are proud of you.\" Ngo said, looking down on her clipboard and taking notes.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know my real parents,\" he said plainly, eyes shifting back down to his shoes.</p>\n<p>Ngo wrote this down before continuing. \"Does that bother you, James?\"</p>\n<p>\"Why?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, most people know their parents. Though based on your file, I know you are not exactly a normal kid.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm an ess-see-pee. Ess-see-pee-8726. My mom and dad were from Site-17, but I spent a long time with Dr. Everwood in Site-55 with Rex, May, and Chidi. But now Dr. Reynders is my mom and Dr. Everwood is my parent.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's right.\" Ngo blinked. How much had they told him about his nature? Surely telling a kid this much, especially one that was also an anomaly was against some sort of ethics code. \"Who told you all of this, James?\"</p>\n<p>\"The people I was with before Dr. Everwood,\" he stated innocently. Ngo sighed and flipped through her clipboard's attached SCP-8726 file, taking note of the fact that James had indeed originally come from Site-17.</p>\n<p><em>What a terrible place,</em> she thought. \"Well, James, we at Site-43 do things differently.\"</p>\n<p>\"I know.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes. We live in a house and not underground like everyone else.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's true. You're very smart, James.\" Ngo looked over at him, noticing he was biting his fingernails.</p>\n<p>No response.</p>\n<p>\"Is something bothering you?\"</p>\n<p>He nodded.</p>\n<p>\"What is it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Why is your name Dr. No?\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't understand.\"</p>\n<p>\"Your name is Dr. No. Why aren't you Dr. Yes?\"</p>\n<p>Ngo was taken aback momentarily, but laughed at his question.</p>\n<p>\"My name is Dr. Ngo. N-G-O.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's a weird name.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's not a very nice thing to say, James.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sorry\u2026\" The boy shrunk away, somehow managing to avoid eye contact even harder.</p>\n<p>\"It's okay, you didn't know. But now you do. It's a Vietnamese name. My parents are from Vietnam.\"</p>\n<p>\"What is Vietnam?\" He looked up quizzically.</p>\n<p>\"A country in east Asia. Would you like for me to show you it?\"</p>\n<p>His eyes lit up. Ngo smiled and produced her phone from within her pocket. She unlocked it and looked up information on the country, then moved to sit behind James. Maps, images of landscapes, water puppet theater, \u00d0\u00f4ng H\u1ed3 paintings, the former imperial city of Hu\u1ebf, \u00c1o d\u00e0i, the H\u00f9ng Kings' Festival, and images of Hanoi; time continued to creep forward, and Ngo and James only became more invested in their little exchange. Eventually, he was resting his head on her shoulder as they continued to talk.</p>\n<p>After some time of sharing her culture with James, she decided it was time to get back on track. \"Very cool, right?\" she asked, locking her phone and putting it away.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah! I liked the dragons.\"</p>\n<p>\"Me too! But James, I wanted to talk to you about how you were feeling about being here.\" Ngo retreated to her armchair, leaving James behind on the couch. He seemed disappointed, but willing to accept that the cool part of meeting her was over.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"You can tell me. It's my job to listen.\"</p>\n<p>James covered his face with his hands, a gesture Ngo found endearing.</p>\n<p>\"Everything you tell me is also confidential. That means I don't have to tell your parents,\" she said, taking note of his behavior on her clipboard.</p>\n<p>\"Really?\" he asked, moving a finger out of the way of his left eye to peek out.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, really. Anything you want to tell me, I can't tell them.\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026. I miss the kids I used to play with.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see. Being around someone your age can be a good way to stay enriched. But James, there are difficulties in that because\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't get old.\" His hands left his face, which was now formed into a slight pout.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026 Yes.\" Ngo sighed. \"But I know of a few people who also don't get old.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mom doesn't get old.\"</p>\n<p>\"Besides her. They're all grown-ups though, so I don't know how you would get along with them.\" Her voice trailed off a bit at the end of the sentence.</p>\n<p>\"It's okay. I know how to talk to grown-ups. Even if they like to boss me around.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm not here to boss you around, James.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're nice to me. But I know you're just a grown-up doing a job.\"</p>\n<p>Ngo paused, taken aback by the kid's bluntness. Though he hadn't strictly said as much, he had just effectively told her to take a hike for trying to psychoanalyze him.</p>\n<p>\"That's right. And right now, my job is to make sure you're doing okay. So tell me, are you doing okay, James?\"</p>\n<p>\"No.\"</p>\n<p>Again with the bluntness. There was a brief silence, accentuated by Ngo writing notes on her clipboard.</p>\n<p>\"Sorry to hear that. What else is bothering you?\"</p>\n<p>Silence. James fidgeted in his seat.</p>\n<p>\"Would you like some paper and colors to help you get your feelings out?\"</p>\n<p>He nodded vigorously, watching as the woman then stood to fetch some copy papers from her desk, alongside a pack of crayons she had bought in anticipation of his appointment. She handed them to James, who eagerly took them and started drawing on the floor of her office.</p>\n<p>\"What are you drawing there, James?\"</p>\n<p>\"It's a secret.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay. So now that you're drawing, do you want to tell me what else is on your mind?\"</p>\n<p>\"Mom keeps eating the Gushers. My parent says that she's just excited to have new food after something that happened to her, but they won't tell me what.\"</p>\n<p>\"Your mom\u2026 she had something bad happen to her. Something to do with\u2026 actually, I don't think they want to tell you what happened to her yet.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why?\"</p>\n<p>\"Why what?\" Ngo asked.</p>\n<p>\"Why don't they want to tell me?\"</p>\n<p>\"Because it's a lot for a kid like you to take in.\"</p>\n<p>\"But I want to know.\"</p>\n<p>\"We can ask your parent when they come to get you, how does that sound?\"</p>\n<p>James hesitated for a moment but eventually nodded.</p>\n<p>\"Okay. Good. Now, James, I want you to tell me about how you feel about your time in Site-17\u2026\"</p>\n\n<p>A knock at the door. It was Everwood, holding James' Switch. James got up and ran towards them, hugging their leg.</p>\n<p>\"Hey, Dr. Ngo. How was it?\" they grinned.</p>\n<p>\"As far as psychotherapy sessions go, not very fruitful, but I'm glad to report that we have established a degree of rapport. His next session will likely be much better.\" Ngo watched as James took back his Switch and activated it again, sounds of a Pokemon battle becoming audible.</p>\n<p>\"Well, that's good. I wanted to ask, can we bring him back again next week?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh? Sure. Any particular reason?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm worried that moving him to a new environment might be impacting him negatively. That and it's hard for him to make friends his age since, you know. Oh and, there's my inevitable mortality.\" Everwood's volume reduced as they spoke, but James still picked up on it.</p>\n<p>\"What does mortality mean?\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't worry about it yet, kiddo.\" they fussed his hair, and he returned his focus to his game.</p>\n<p>Ngo nodded. \"I understand. It would be my pleasure to see him next week. What do you say, James? Are you looking forward to seeing me in a few days?\"</p>\n<p>He didn't respond; too enraptured by the Venonat he was battling. Everwood nudged him. \"James.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, Dr. Ngo,\" he replied, looking up at her with a smile.</p>\n<p>\"Alright. We'll see you around, Nhung. Thank you.\" Everwood waved and turned with James in tow. Ngo followed them out into the hallway, arms folded and smiling as the two walked away. James looked up from his game to Everwood and tugged at their empty sleeve.</p>\n<p>\"What happened to mom?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>Ngo blanked, she had forgotten. Everwood turned to look back at her. They made brief eye contact, during which Everwood was able to discern that Ngo hadn't fully told him, but may have let some details slip. Everwood sighed and turned to James, who was looking up at them.</p>\n<p>\"What do you mean?\" they asked, hoping it was a misunderstanding.</p>\n<p>\"Dr. Ngo said that something bad happen to mom a long time ago. What happened to her?\"</p>\n<p>\"James, honey. This is a conversation we need to have with her present, okay?\"</p>\n<p>\"But I want to know!\"</p>\n<p>Everwood sighed, kneeling down to have their head at the same level as James'. They put their only hand on his right shoulder and took a deep breath.</p>\n<p>\"Your mom\u2026 she had an accident in the ADDC a long time ago.\"</p>\n<p>\"What's ADDC?\"</p>\n<p>\"Anomalous Document Disposal Chamber.\"</p>\n<p>He blinked in confusion. Everwood smiled and looked down for a moment, then back to him.</p>\n<p>\"It's where they got rid of weird books and things like that.\"</p>\n<p>James nodded.</p>\n<p>\"Anyway. She got stuck down there in 1943 and only got out a little less than four years ago.\"</p>\n<p>He started counting on his fingers before giving up at nine.</p>\n<p>Everwood laughed and Ngo grinned.</p>\n<p>\"Whatcha counting there, buddy?\" They asked.</p>\n<p>\"The years mom was in there.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're gonna run out of fingers mighty quick if you triy that.\" Everwood chuckled, fussing his hair. \"But anyway, we really should talk about this with your mom. So we'll do that when we get back to Grand Bend, okay?\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay.\"</p>\n<p>The one-armed doctor rose to their full height and looked over to the psychologist.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, Nhung.\"</p>\n<p>\"I didn't do anything. That young man is very emotionally mature for his age.\" She shrugged.</p>\n<p>\"I'm old for my age.\" James nonchalantly said, returning his attention to his game.</p>\n<p>\"Oh! Before you go, Jay. Look what James drew today.\" Ngo reached over to her desk and grabbed the paper the boy had been doodling on earlier. \"Isn't it lovely?\"</p>\n\n<div class=\"earthworm earthworm--old-syntax-first-false earthworm--old-syntax-last-false earthworm--old-syntax-hub-yes {$class}\">\n<div class=\"first earthworm__previous\" data-title=\"The Pursuit Of Knowledge, And Other Frivolities\">\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/\">The Pursuit Of Knowledge, And Other Frivolities</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"hub earthworm__hub\" data-title=\"On Guard 43 Hub\">\n<p><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/on-guard-43-hub\">On Guard 43 Hub</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"last earthworm__next\" data-title=\"The World Was Quiet Here\">\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/\">The World Was Quiet Here</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<div class=\"collection\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">More\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">More\u00a0From\u00a0This\u00a0Author</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<table style=\"1px solid black; width: 100%;\">\n<tr>\n<th class=\"namerow\" colspan=\"2\"><div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p>Uncle Nicolini's Works</p>\n</div>\n</div></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"titlecolumn\">SCPs</th>\n<th class=\"articlecolumn\"><div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-7727\">SCP-7727</a> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-es-113\">SCP-ES-113</a> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-6911\">SCP-6911</a> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-4026\">SCP-4026</a> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-4967\">SCP-4967</a> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-3863\">SCP-3863</a> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-654\">SCP-654</a> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-7260\">SCP-7260</a> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-6832\">SCP-6832</a> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-371-j\">SCP-371-J</a> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-es-357\">SCP-ES-357</a> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-1712\">SCP-1712</a> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-4934\">SCP-4934</a> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-1841\">SCP-1841</a> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-3867\">SCP-3867</a> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n</div></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"titlecolumn\">Tales/GoI Formats</th>\n<th class=\"articlecolumn\"><div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/aces-deuces\">Aces Deuces</a> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/grant-request-post-mortem-neural-preservation\">GRANT REQUEST FOR THE RE-CREATION OF AN ADVANCED POSTMORTEM NEURAL PRESERVATION SYSTEM</a> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/merry-christmas-jude-kriyot\">Merry Christmas, Jude Kriyot</a> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/sebastian\">Sebastian</a> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/yamizushi-file-no995\">Dark Sushi File No. 995 \"Suisame\"</a> <span class=\"collectiondot\">\u2022</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<p><a href=\"/surprise-happy-birthday-12\">Surprise!

Though it mostly consisted of the usual suspects, today would be the first time she was going to meet a new patient, one that was causing her usually calm demeanor to falter. She had met anomalies, she had met immortal beings, she had met children.\n\n\n\nBut she had never met a [[[scp-8726|permanently 6-year-old immortal]]].\n\n\n\nJames Everwood-Reynders, the adopted son of Site-43's new resident GoI Specialist and Acroamatic Abatement Chair, was due for his bi-yearly checkup; his first since coming to Site-43 from Site-55 down in Boston. Ngo knew that he had been born from the D-Class Parenthood Program, one of probably the most messed up things she had ever heard the Foundation was actively doing. And that included whatever the hell was going on in 17.\n\n\n\nShe had read his file; Ngo knew that Dr. Everwood had fought to ensure he was treated like a peer after he was brought onto their team to assist in Dr. Wondertainment research, but had somehow wound up adopting him somewhere along the way. Site-55 was a weird place, but as weird as it was, Site-43 was even weirder still. Due to it's weirdness and resident immortal/James' adopted mother Dr. Ilse Reynders, this seemed like a good place to raise him. //Better than 17//, Ngo thought.\n\n\n\nA knock at the door. \n\n\n\n\"Come in,\" she said, putting on a warm smile. \n\n\n\nThe door opened to reveal a person wearing a sweater with only one sleeve full and a little boy holding a Nintendo Switch, wearing a poofy jacket and knitted cap.\n\n\n\n\"Hello, Dr. Ngo. I hope you don't mind we're early.\" Jay Everwood smiled at Ngo, their hand on the boy's left shoulder. \"James, //como se dice?//\"\n\n\n\n\"Hi.\" James didn't look up from his Switch.\n\n\n\n\"No worries at all, Jay. How is Dr. Reynders?\" She got up from her desk, picking up a clipboard.\n\n\n\n\"Ilse is well. She's still obsessed with Gushers; to the point where James here can barely sneak one packet whenever we buy a box. But high fructose corn syrup aside, they are doing okay.\" Everwood laughed.\n\n\n\n\"That's great to hear. Maybe not the high fructose corn syrup bit, but I'm glad she's enjoying life. Come in, come in.\" \n\n\n\nEverwood and James entered the office, and his adoptive parent held out their hand to him, signaling to hand over the toy. James grumbled but obliged, putting his Switch into sleep mode and letting them take it.\n\n\n\n\"You'll get it back when you're done with Dr. Ngo, okay?\" \n\n\n\n\"Okay...\" He pouted.\n\n\n\n\"Come on, sit on the couch and listen to what she has to say, and make sure to answer her questions. Be good. Love you.\" Everwood leaned down and kissed the top of James' head. The boy hopped up onto Ngo's couch while the psychologist sat across from him in a comfy arm chair.\n\n\n\n\"See you in an hour, Jay.\" Ngo grinned as they waved a goodbye to her, shutting the door behind them.\n\n\n\nThe boy seemed standoffish. He was not making eye contact, instead opting to stare at his shoes. She cleared her throat and reached behind her ear for a pen to start taking notes.\n\n\n\n\"Hello, James. My name is Dr. Ngo.\"\n\n\n\nNo response came.\n\n\n\n\"Your parent tells me you're a very sweet kid. What do you think?\" \n\n\n\nNo response once more.\n\n\n\n\"Are you shy?\" \n\n\n\nHe nodded, but did not look up.\n\n\n\n\"Well, that's okay. I am a stranger, after all, but I'm a friend of your parents and I'm here to help you assimilate into Site-43.\"\n\n\n\n\"What does ass... assimini... assimilate mean?\" James looked up but appeared to be staring through her.\n\n\n\n\"It means to make yourself at home.\" Ngo smiled reassuringly.\n\n\n\n\"My old home was Site-55. I used to play with Rex, May, and Chidi. They were my parent's em...employees.\" \n\n\n\n\"Wow, you're using big words, James. I'm sure both your parents are proud of you.\" Ngo said, looking down on her clipboard and taking notes. \n\n\n\n\"I don't know my real parents,\" he said plainly, eyes shifting back down to his shoes.\n\n\n\nNgo wrote this down before continuing. \"Does that bother you, James?\"\n\n\n\n\"Why?\" \n\n\n\n\"Well, most people know their parents. Though based on your file, I know you are not exactly a normal kid.\" \n\n\n\n\"I'm an ess-see-pee. Ess-see-pee-8726. My mom and dad were from Site-17, but I spent a long time with Dr. Everwood in Site-55 with Rex, May, and Chidi. But now Dr. Reynders is my mom and Dr. Everwood is my parent.\" \n\n\n\n\"That's right.\" Ngo blinked. How much had they told him about his nature? Surely telling a kid this much, especially one that was also an anomaly was against some sort of ethics code. \"Who told you all of this, James?\"\n\n\n\n\"The people I was with before Dr. Everwood,\" he stated innocently. Ngo sighed and flipped through her clipboard's attached SCP-8726 file, taking note of the fact that James had indeed originally come from Site-17. \n\n\n\n//What a terrible place,// she thought. \"Well, James, we at Site-43 do things differently.\"\n\n\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes. We live in a house and not underground like everyone else.\" \n\n\n\n\"That's true. You're very smart, James.\" Ngo looked over at him, noticing he was biting his fingernails.\n\n\n\nNo response.\n\n\n\n\"Is something bothering you?\" \n\n\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\n\n\"Why is your name Dr. No?\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\n\n\"Your name is Dr. No. Why aren't you Dr. Yes?\"\n\n\n\nNgo was taken aback momentarily, but laughed at his question.\n\n\n\n\"My name is Dr. Ngo. N-G-O.\" \n\n\n\n\"That's a weird name.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's not a very nice thing to say, James.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sorry...\" The boy shrunk away, somehow managing to avoid eye contact even harder.\n\n\n\n\"It's okay, you didn't know. But now you do. It's a Vietnamese name. My parents are from Vietnam.\"\n\n\n\n\"What is Vietnam?\" He looked up quizzically. \n\n\n\n\"A country in east Asia. Would you like for me to show you it?\"\n\n\n\nHis eyes lit up. Ngo smiled and produced her phone from within her pocket. She unlocked it and looked up information on the country, then moved to sit behind James. Maps, images of landscapes, water puppet theater, \u00d0\u00f4ng H\u1ed3 paintings, the former imperial city of Hu\u1ebf, \u00c1o d\u00e0i, the H\u00f9ng Kings' Festival, and images of Hanoi; time continued to creep forward, and Ngo and James only became more invested in their little exchange. Eventually, he was resting his head on her shoulder as they continued to talk.\n\n\n\nAfter some time of sharing her culture with James, she decided it was time to get back on track. \"Very cool, right?\"\u00a0\u00a0she asked, locking her phone and putting it away.\n\n\n\n\"Yeah! I liked the dragons.\"\n\n\n\n\"Me too! But James, I wanted to talk to you about how you were feeling about being here.\" Ngo retreated to her armchair, leaving James behind on the couch. He seemed disappointed, but willing to accept that the cool part of meeting her was over.\n\n\n\n\"I don't know...\" \n\n\n\n\"You can tell me. It's my job to listen.\"\n\n\n\nJames covered his face with his hands, a gesture Ngo found endearing.\n\n\n\n\"Everything you tell me is also confidential. That means I don't have to tell your parents,\" she said, taking note of his behavior on her clipboard.\n\n\n\n\"Really?\" he asked, moving a finger out of the way of his left eye to peek out.\n\n\n\n\"Yes, really. Anything you want to tell me, I can't tell them.\" \n\n\n\n\".... I miss the kids I used to play with.\"\n\n\n\n\"I see. Being around someone your age can be a good way to stay enriched. But James, there are difficulties in that because--\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't get old.\" His hands left his face, which was now formed into a slight pout.\n\n\n\n\"... Yes.\" Ngo sighed. \"But I know of a few people who also don't get old.\"\n\n\n\n\"Mom doesn't get old.\"\n\n\n\n\"Besides her. They're all grown-ups though, so I don't know how you would get along with them.\" Her voice trailed off a bit at the end of the sentence.\n\n\n\n\"It's okay. I know how to talk to grown-ups. Even if they like to boss me around.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm not here to boss you around, James.\"\n\n\n\n\"You're nice to me. But I know you're just a grown-up doing a job.\"\n\n\n\nNgo paused, taken aback by the kid's bluntness. Though he hadn't strictly said as much, he had just effectively told her to take a hike for trying to psychoanalyze him. \n\n\n\n\"That's right. And right now, my job is to make sure you're doing okay. So tell me, are you doing okay, James?\"\n\n\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\n\nAgain with the bluntness. There was a brief silence, accentuated by Ngo writing notes on her clipboard. \n\n\n\n\"Sorry to hear that. What else is bothering you?\"\n\n\n\nSilence. James fidgeted in his seat.\n\n\n\n\"Would you like some paper and colors to help you get your feelings out?\"\n\n\n\nHe nodded vigorously, watching as the woman then stood to fetch some copy papers from her desk, alongside a pack of crayons she had bought in anticipation of his appointment. She handed them to James, who eagerly took them and started drawing on the floor of her office.\n\n\n\n\"What are you drawing there, James?\"\n\n\n\n\"It's a secret.\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay. So now that you're drawing, do you want to tell me what else is on your mind?\"\n\n\n\n\"Mom keeps eating the Gushers. My parent says that she's just excited to have new food after something that happened to her, but they won't tell me what.\"\n\n\n\n\"Your mom... she had something bad happen to her. Something to do with... actually, I don't think they want to tell you what happened to her yet.\"\n\n\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\n\n\"Why what?\" Ngo asked.\n\n\n\n\"Why don't they want to tell me?\"\n\n\n\n\"Because it's a lot for a kid like you to take in.\"\n\n\n\n\"But I want to know.\"\n\n\n\n\"We can ask your parent when they come to get you, how does that sound?\" \n\n\n\nJames hesitated for a moment but eventually nodded.\n\n\n\n\"Okay. Good. Now, James, I want you to tell me about how you feel about your time in Site-17...\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nA knock at the door. It was Everwood, holding James' Switch. James got up and ran towards them, hugging their leg.\n\n\n\n\"Hey, Dr. Ngo. How was it?\" they grinned. \n\n\n\n\"As far as psychotherapy sessions go, not very fruitful, but I'm glad to report that we have established a degree of rapport. His next session will likely be much better.\" Ngo watched as James took back his Switch and activated it again, sounds of a Pokemon battle becoming audible.\n\n\n\n\"Well, that's good. I wanted to ask, can we bring him back again next week?\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh? Sure. Any particular reason?\" \n\n\n\n\"I'm worried that moving him to a new environment might be impacting him negatively. That and it's hard for him to make friends his age since, you know. Oh and, there's my inevitable mortality.\"\u00a0\u00a0Everwood's volume reduced as they spoke, but James still picked up on it.\n\n\n\n\"What does mortality mean?\"\n\n\n\n\"Don't worry about it yet, kiddo.\" they fussed his hair, and he returned his focus to his game.\n\n\n\nNgo nodded. \"I understand. It would be my pleasure to see him next week. What do you say, James? Are you looking forward to seeing me in a few days?\"\n\n\n\nHe didn't respond; too enraptured by the Venonat he was battling. Everwood nudged him. \"James.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, Dr. Ngo,\" he replied, looking up at her with a smile.\n\n\n\n\"Alright. We'll see you around, Nhung. Thank you.\" Everwood waved and turned with James in tow. Ngo followed them out into the hallway, arms folded and smiling as the two walked away. James looked up from his game to Everwood and tugged at their empty sleeve.\n\n\n\n\"What happened to mom?\" he asked.\n\n\n\nNgo blanked, she had forgotten. Everwood turned to look back at her. They made brief eye contact, during which Everwood was able to discern that Ngo hadn't fully told him, but may have let some details slip. Everwood sighed and turned to James, who was looking up at them. \n\n\n\n\"What do you mean?\" they asked, hoping it was a misunderstanding.\n\n\n\n\"Dr. Ngo said that something bad happen to mom a long time ago. What happened to her?\"\n\n\n\n\"James, honey. This is a conversation we need to have with her present, okay?\" \n\n\n\n\"But I want to know!\"\n\n\n\nEverwood sighed, kneeling down to have their head at the same level as James'. They put their only hand on his right shoulder and took a deep breath.\n\n\n\n\"Your mom... she had an accident in the ADDC a long time ago.\"\n\n\n\n\"What's ADDC?\"\n\n\n\n\"Anomalous Document Disposal Chamber.\"\n\n\n\nHe blinked in confusion. Everwood smiled and looked down for a moment, then back to him.\n\n\n\n\"It's where they got rid of weird books and things like that.\"\n\n\n\nJames nodded.\n\n\n\n\"Anyway. She got stuck down there in 1943 and only got out a little less than four years ago.\"\n\n\n\nHe started counting on his fingers before giving up at nine.\n\n\n\nEverwood laughed and Ngo grinned.\n\n\n\n\"Whatcha counting there, buddy?\" They asked.\n\n\n\n\"The years mom was in there.\"\n\n\n\n\"You're gonna run out of fingers mighty quick if you triy that.\" Everwood chuckled, fussing his hair. \"But anyway, we really should talk about this with your mom. So we'll do that when we get back to Grand Bend, okay?\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay.\" \n\n\n\nThe one-armed doctor rose to their full height and looked over to the psychologist. \n\n\n\n\"Thank you, Nhung.\"\n\n\n\n\"I didn't do anything. That young man is very emotionally mature for his age.\" She shrugged.\n\n\n\n\"I'm old for my age.\" James nonchalantly said, returning his attention to his game.\n\n\n\n\"Oh! Before you go, Jay. Look what James drew today.\" Ngo reached over to her desk and grabbed the paper the boy had been doodling on earlier. \"Isn't it lovely?\"\n\n\n\n[[=image ngo.png]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:earthworm\">:scp-wiki:component:earthworm</a>\n\n| first=false | last=false| hub=yes\n\n| previous-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ | previous-title=The Pursuit Of Knowledge, And Other Frivolities\n\n| next-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ | next-title=The World Was Quiet Here\n\n| hub-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/on-guard-43-hub | hub-title=On Guard 43 Hub\n\n]]\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:wikimodule\">:scp-wiki:component:wikimodule</a> |normal= --]]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** ngo.png\n\n> **Author:** [[*user Agente Shuffle]]\n\n> **License:** CC BY SA 3.0\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-8726", "on-guard-43-hub", "scp-7727", "scp-es-113", "scp-6911", "scp-4026", "scp-4967", "scp-3863", "scp-654", "scp-7260", "scp-6832", "scp-371-j", "scp-es-357", "scp-1712", "scp-4934", "scp-1841", "scp-3867", "aces-deuces", "grant-request-post-mortem-neural-preservation", "merry-christmas-jude-kriyot", "sebastian", "yamizushi-file-no995", "surprise-happy-birthday-12", "september-eleven-prequel", "chicago-factory", "lillian-lillihammer-and-the-great-meme-war", "omega-k-049", "who-wants-to-live-forever", "cimmerian-sends-650-pms", "seven-days-with-mr-fish", "gentle-wings-flutter-quietly-in-the-dark", "error-404-database-not-found", "uncle-nicolini-author-page", "ode-to-the-unknown-author", "sciptember-2022-art", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["art-exchange", "doctor-everwood", "on-guard-43", "researcher-james", "slice-of-life", "tale"], "title": "Pediatric Para-Psychology - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/pediatric-para-psychology", "year": 2025}, "the-lake-oahe-monster": {"created_at": "2025-01-02T19:02:00", "creator": "ubergoober", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "ubergoober", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ubergoober", "comment": "", "date": "2025-01-02T19:02:00"}, {"author": "ubergoober", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ubergoober", "comment": "Added tags: comedy, director-moose, doctor-gears, doctor-gerald, hard-to-destroy-reptile, tale.

Put that it's dead,\" Moose said, peering over Gears' shoulder, having returned with a sizable plastic bag.</p>\n<p>\"Are we <em>sure</em> it's dead?\" Dee asked, nervously looking over at the carcass. Its fin-like limbs were sprawled out on the sand, a mop of decaying flesh covered its skull, and blood dripped from its maw onto the mud below. Dee could taste the stench of its fly-swarmed intestines in their mouth.</p>\n<p>\"I didn't include that information for a reason.

Now, let's get shoveling,\"</p>\n<p>With that, the three got to work, using their shovels to scoop up mounds of creature's flesh, and heaving it into the bag. Dee wondered how they would transport the remains back to Site 19, given that it weighed over two thousand pounds. The repugnant stench emanating from the pile of rotting flesh filled the air, only made worse by humid the August heat. Dee could feel the sliminess of the dead animal's fatty tissue through their gloves, which when stepped on produced a sickening <em>squelch.</em> Moose, too, loathed every bit of this cleanup job, though as the boss they had to retain their composure as the three shoveled heaps of bones and tendons into the bag. Gears was the most calm; of the three, he had been a Safe Cleanup Professional the longest, and as a result he was used to these things. Nonetheless, he too had reservations about this job, though they didn't inhibit his work ethic.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the next hour, the plastic bag continued to fill with decaying tissue as the three toiled away in the late summer heat. It was as Dee was shoveling in a particularly sticky clump of sinew and bone that they heard a bellowing come from the creature's mouth.</p>\n<p>\"Uh, Moose? Gears? You hear that?\"</p>\n<p>Moose looked up. \"Hmm?\"</p>\n<p>\"Did you not hear the creature growl? It's like\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Like it's still alive?</p>\n<p>\"Well, yeah.\"</p>\n<p>Moose rolled their eyes dismissively. \"Don't worry about it\u2014 it was probably just air being released. Keep cleaning, we're almost done.\"</p>\n<p>The last part of the remains that needed to be hauled into the bag was the head of the leviathan, which lay on the muddy ground connected to the rest of the body by strings of sinew and broken bones. The stench emanating from the creature's mouth made Dee regret having eaten lunch a couple hours prior. Nonetheless, ignoring the stink and the low growling that Moose was so sure was normal, Dee shoveled the last of it into the plastic bag, and Gears tied it shut.</p>\n<p>\"Alright, well done team,\" said Moose. \"Pat yourselves on the back\u2014 preferably after taking your gloves off. I'll call the city and tell them we're done here.\"</p>\n<p>Just as Moose was about to dial in the number for the local authorities, the bag began to shake.</p>\n<p>\"What the fuck?\" exclaimed Dee.</p>\n<p>\"It appears our specimen may still have some life in it after all,\" Gears replied.</p>\n<p>\"Ew, shit, get away from it!\" Dee slowly backed away from the bag, which was twitching violently, shaking and rattling as if the lifeless remains of the creature were fighting to escape their prison. The three janitors retreated slowly from the grotesque spectacle; the plastic bag came apart at the seams, with bony claws tearing through the polyester and writhing about in the open summer air. The groaning of the fallen behemoth drew in air to colossal, decaying lungs with a dreadful moan that made Dee wince; still, they were frozen in horror as they gazed upon their hard work unwrapping itself like a burrito of flesh and tissue. Slowly, the deceased leviathan rose, the muddy earth trembling as it did, with a malignant glimmer in its once-dead eyes.</p>\n<p>For a moment, the cleanup crew and the monster stared at one another in silence; Dee could feel their heart pounding in their chest, now faced with the living, breathing carcass. The reptilian creature's hollow eyes glinted yellow, its decrepit flesh dangling in a mop to the side of its skeletal head. The entire bony frame of the monster was held together by threadbare strands of tissue; flesh, meat, and bone all conglomerated together into a revolting, fifteen-foot abomination with a sickening appearance.</p>\n<p>The beast gave a low growl, and muttered a single word.</p>\n<p><span class=\"disgusting\"><em>\"Disgusting.\"</em></span></p>\n<p>The creature lunged at Dee first, snarling and snapping its jaws, nearly putting a gash into their stomach. Dee stumbled backwards, wielding their shovel in an attempt to defend themselves. The creature trundled towards them; Moose swung with their own shovel, missing entirely, before the creature snapped again. As the monster closed in on Dee, it gave a sickening roar, with spittle dripping from its mouth onto the muddy grass, melting it on contact. The creature reared up to take a bite out of its victim's stomach, when its jaws were slammed shut by Gears, who had rolled up his sleeves, ready to fight.</p>\n<p>\"Oh my god\u2014 thanks, Gears!\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't talk. Back away.\"</p>\n<p>The monster thrashed, swinging at Gears with its claws, and he released the animal just in time to avoid a nasty slash to his chest. Jaws dripping with rancid saliva, it lumbered slowly towards Moose next. They hit it squarely in the snout with their shovel, briefly disorienting the creature. Roaring, it pounced at Moose, but Gears was ready with his shovel again, sticking it between the animal's jaws. The creature clamped down on the shovel handle, snapping the wood in half.</p>\n<p>\"What are you guys doing? Run!\" Dee yelled, dragging Moose back to their feet. While the creature took a moment to swallow Gears' shovel, the three hastily retreated from the lakeside. As Dee turned back to take another look at the beast, they watched it rapidly shed its own skin, leaving behind a pile of atrophied flesh on the ground. The creature opened its mouth, and burped loudly.</p>\n<p>The creature snarled, and charged at the three janitors with unexpected speed. Dee, Moose, and Gears continued to sprint as fast as they possibly good, this time towards the road. Adrenaline filled their veins, and none dared look backward as the rhythmic thumping of scaly claws on the ground grew louder and closer.</p>\n<p>\"Left!\" Dee shouted as the three approached the roadside, narrowly avoiding the onslaught of traffic.</p>\n<p>The creature trampled towards them, crossing onto the road, with a roar louder than even the engines of the oncoming traffic. Cars swerved around the creature as it pursued the three, with many pulling over on the side of the road to take pictures of the gigantic lizard stomping down the lanes. The janitors running up the roadside could smell its rancid breath as it closed in, its jaws open wide and dripping with saliva.</p>\n<p><em>WHAM.</em></p>\n<p>A twenty-ton semi-truck had collided with the beast, sending the monster reeling onto its side.</p>\n<p>The big rig pulled over on the side of the road. A tall, burly man in a red baseball cap and a tank top climbed out of the driver's seat.</p>\n<p>\"Aw hell, was that your, uh, crocodile?\" he asked with concern.</p>\n<p>\"Uh, something like that,\" Moose replied.</p>\n<p>\"Sorry y'all, that one's on me.\"</p>\n<p>As cars swerved to avoid the massive incapacitated lake monster fallen on the side of the road, Gears inspected the fallen animal. \"It's down, but not out. I suggest we make haste,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"Name's Radcliffe Gerald.\" The truck driver extended a meaty hand to Moose, who shook his with their own, much skinnier fingers.</p>\n<p>\"I'm Tilda Moose. Safe Cleanup Professionals. We're trying to clean up after this animal. You\u2026 wouldn't happen to be currently employed, would you?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nope, still lookin' for\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Good, you're hired.

The repugnant stench emanating from the pile of rotting flesh filled the air, only made worse by humid the August heat. Dee could feel the sliminess of the dead animal's fatty tissue through their gloves, which when stepped on produced a sickening //squelch.// Moose, too, loathed every bit of this cleanup job, though as the boss they had to retain their composure as the three shoveled heaps of bones and tendons into the bag. Gears was the most calm; of the three, he had been a Safe Cleanup Professional the longest, and as a result he was used to these things. Nonetheless, he too had reservations about this job, though they didn't inhibit his work ethic.\n\n\n\nOver the course of the next hour, the plastic bag continued to fill with decaying tissue as the three toiled away in the late summer heat. It was as Dee was shoveling in a particularly sticky clump of sinew and bone that they heard a bellowing come from the creature's mouth.\n\n\n\n\"Uh, Moose? Gears? You hear that?\"\n\n\n\nMoose looked up. \"Hmm?\"\n\n\n\n\"Did you not hear the creature growl? It's like\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\"Like it's still alive? \n\n\n\n\"Well, yeah.\"\n\n\n\nMoose rolled their eyes dismissively. \"Don't worry about it-- it was probably just air being released. Keep cleaning, we're almost done.\"\n\n\n\nThe last part of the remains that needed to be hauled into the bag was the head of the leviathan, which lay on the muddy ground connected to the rest of the body by strings of sinew and broken bones. The stench emanating from the creature's mouth made Dee regret having eaten lunch a couple hours prior. Nonetheless, ignoring the stink and the low growling that Moose was so sure was normal, Dee shoveled the last of it into the plastic bag, and Gears tied it shut.\n\n\n\n\"Alright, well done team,\" said Moose. \"Pat yourselves on the back-- preferably after taking your gloves off. I'll call the city and tell them we're done here.\" \n\n\n\nJust as Moose was about to dial in the number for the local authorities, the bag began to shake. \n\n\n\n\"What the fuck?\" exclaimed Dee.\n\n\n\n\"It appears our specimen may still have some life in it after all,\" Gears replied.\n\n\n\n\"Ew, shit, get away from it!\" Dee slowly backed away from the bag, which was twitching violently, shaking and rattling as if the lifeless remains of the creature were fighting to escape their prison. The three janitors retreated slowly from the grotesque spectacle; the plastic bag came apart at the seams, with bony claws tearing through the polyester and writhing about in the open summer air. The groaning of the fallen behemoth drew in air to colossal, decaying lungs with a dreadful moan that made Dee wince; still, they were frozen in horror as they gazed upon their hard work unwrapping itself like a burrito of flesh and tissue. Slowly, the deceased leviathan rose, the muddy earth trembling as it did, with\u00a0\u00a0a malignant glimmer in its once-dead eyes.\n\n\n\nFor a moment, the cleanup crew and the monster stared at one another in silence; Dee could feel their heart pounding in their chest, now faced with the living, breathing carcass. The reptilian creature's hollow eyes glinted yellow, its decrepit flesh dangling in a mop to the side of its skeletal head. The entire bony frame of the monster was held together by threadbare strands of tissue; flesh, meat, and bone all conglomerated together into a revolting, fifteen-foot abomination with a sickening appearance.\n\n\n\nThe beast gave a low growl, and muttered a single word.\n\n\n\n[[span class=\"disgusting\"]]//\"Disgusting.\"//[[/span]]\n\n\n\nThe creature lunged at Dee first, snarling and snapping its jaws, nearly putting a gash into their stomach. Dee stumbled backwards, wielding their shovel in an attempt to defend themselves. The creature trundled towards them; Moose swung with their own shovel, missing entirely, before the creature snapped again. As the monster closed in on Dee, it gave a sickening roar, with spittle dripping from its mouth onto the muddy grass, melting it on contact. The creature reared up to take a bite out of its victim's stomach, when its jaws were slammed shut by Gears, who had rolled up his sleeves, ready to fight.\n\n\n\n\"Oh my god-- thanks, Gears!\"\n\n\n\n\"Don't talk. Back away.\"\n\n\n\nThe monster thrashed, swinging at Gears with its claws, and he released the animal just in time to avoid a nasty slash to his chest. Jaws dripping with rancid saliva, it lumbered slowly towards Moose next. They hit it squarely in the snout with their shovel, briefly disorienting the creature. Roaring, it pounced at Moose, but Gears was ready with his shovel again, sticking it between the animal's jaws. The creature clamped down on the shovel handle, snapping the wood in half.\n\n\n\n\"What are you guys doing? Run!\" Dee yelled, dragging Moose back to their feet. While the creature took a moment to swallow Gears' shovel, the three hastily retreated from the lakeside. As Dee turned back to take another look at the beast, they watched it rapidly shed its own skin, leaving behind a pile of atrophied flesh on the ground. The creature opened its mouth, and burped loudly.\n\n\n\nThe creature snarled, and charged at the three janitors with unexpected speed. Dee, Moose, and Gears continued to sprint as fast as they possibly good, this time towards the road. Adrenaline filled their veins, and none dared look backward as the rhythmic thumping of scaly claws on the ground grew louder and closer.\n\n\n\n\"Left!\" Dee shouted as the three approached the roadside, narrowly avoiding the onslaught of traffic.\n\n\n\nThe creature trampled towards them, crossing onto the road, with a roar louder than even the engines of the oncoming traffic. Cars swerved around the creature as it pursued the three, with many pulling over on the side of the road to take pictures of the gigantic lizard stomping down the lanes. The janitors running up the roadside could smell its rancid breath as it closed in, its jaws open wide and dripping with saliva.\n\n\n\n//WHAM.//\n\n\n\nA twenty-ton semi-truck had collided with the beast, sending the monster reeling onto its side. \n\n\n\nThe big rig pulled over on the side of the road. A tall, burly man in a red baseball cap and a tank top climbed out of the driver's seat.\n\n\n\n\"Aw hell, was that your, uh, crocodile?\" he asked with concern.\n\n\n\n\"Uh, something like that,\" Moose replied. \n\n\n\n\"Sorry y'all, that one's on me.\"\n\n\n\nAs cars swerved to avoid the massive incapacitated lake monster fallen on the side of the road, Gears inspected the fallen animal. \"It's down, but not out. I suggest we make haste,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"Name's Radcliffe Gerald.\" The truck driver extended a meaty hand to Moose, who shook his with their own, much skinnier fingers. \n\n\n\n\"I'm Tilda Moose. Safe Cleanup Professionals. We're trying to clean up after this animal. You... wouldn't happen to be currently employed, would you?\"\n\n\n\n\"Nope, still lookin' for\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\"Good, you're hired. Help us get this creature in the back of your truck.\"\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["biweekly", "site-19-dossier", "welcome-to-site-19", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["comedy", "director-moose", "doctor-gears", "doctor-gerald", "hard-to-destroy-reptile", "tale"], "title": "The Lake Oahe Monster - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-lake-oahe-monster", "year": 2025}}
